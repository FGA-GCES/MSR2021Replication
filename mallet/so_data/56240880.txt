i have an electron app. the render process show a vue.j app which is creat use webpack. it contain a few config set that are packag up along with all the other code as part of the bundle. i need for the main process to get access to these config set as well. what the best way to do this?on consider is that the environ ( or similar.i'm current use the copywebpackplugin to copi the appropri config file over to anoth folder dure the build and the main process is read the config out of this folder. it work but it a bit clunki and magical.i suppos i could also move all the config data into the main process code and provid it to the render process via ipc upon start up. also seem a bit clunky.i there a better way?
