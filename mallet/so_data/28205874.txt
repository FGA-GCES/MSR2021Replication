i'm write a node-webkit addon in c++ that decod imag data and return an array of pixel data to the caller. the follow code (abridg for brevity) work just fine:caller.jsi know this doesn't work becaus putimagedata() result in a black frame, wherea the origin code success draw the actual frame as expected. here is my question: is it possibl to creat an imagedata object and/or uint8clampedarray in javascript, pass it by refer into a node.j addon, have the addon write to the object memori location, and then be abl to use the object in the javascript context without perform a memori copy??i don't know if i'm do it wrong, or it impossible, or both. :)
