(to same path of chrome extens like in the comput i origin download it had it).then, in my electron project main.js, in a part of my code that is insid the app readi event, i called:im use electron 1.2.5 on windows, if you are go to suggest me to updat my electron version, ill have to say i can't do that, i also have error when updat it (not connect to redux dev tools), which i also ask a question about here.to sum up, if someon has an idea how i can use option 1 in a offlin enviroment, that might help me fix the problem. i would prefer a solut to work with option 2, some way to fix this strang error? to me it look like the error connect to the redux dev tool code, but i'm not sure whi it happen and i couldn't find onlin anyon els that was struggl with this tool and had this error.updatemanag to updat to latest electron, still same problem occur
