when look up electron and offlin html5, i have found it difficult to make a decis between which one to use for a project.assum that a user will have to go to a certain websit to download the electron application, and would have to go to the same websit to get the offlin html5 loaded, what are the pros and con between use one over the other?som that i could think of:offlin html5 can be updat without the user conscious updat their applic by just make the user go to the onlin page again.electron would elimin the need to code around multipl browser/brows version depend and quirk
