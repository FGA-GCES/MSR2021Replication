so i'v look around quit a bit now and wasn't abl to find quit the use case i think i am confront with.for some background:i'm fair new to javascript and have never had to call ani other program/script from it. now i did develop a python script that pull some data from onlin sources, format it and dump it into json files. in order to display this data in a proper way i figur i would use electron.whil handl the json file is complet fine (would be quit sad if it wasn't i guess), i need to be abl to call the python script updat the data from my electron ui. as everyth is local, i hoped, that there would be an easier way, than set up some server for the python script to run on, just to be abl to trigger it execut from my desktop app. this is especi true, as i don't even need to get or process ani returns, i just want to trigger the execut of that script.so the question now is: is there such an "easy" way to execut python script from an electron/javascript base local save desktop app?thank in advanc for ani answers!
