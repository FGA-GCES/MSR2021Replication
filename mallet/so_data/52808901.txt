i'm current work on an electron app that is essenti a ddns launcher for a media server i control. basically, it check for an internet connection, get the current ip for the server, then open it in the system default browser. however, the splash screen that i wrote is total broken. whenev i launch the app on my system (use npm from the terminal), it load the frame, but the imag freez load at about the 1/3 point. it won't load the rest of the imag until the script that it at the bottom of the main html page is finish executing. is there someth i'm miss about this? i can provid excerpt of the code if needed.edit:sourc code excerpt: &#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;pastebin link to the full source: https://pastebin.com/u1izesskthanksdevelop system specs: maco mojav 10.14, latest stabl build of electron
