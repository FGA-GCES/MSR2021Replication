this is my first post - so my apolog if the question is not correct outlin or follow the standards.i'm tri to connect the stream from an electron app to the webbrows (say www.example.com).curr with my setup, when a user goe to www.example.com they get a peer id. additionally, when a user open my electron app that person get a peer id too. however, if i tri to have them call each other - i get the error: my goal is to emit live-stream from an electron-app to a webpage.so far i have been look into webrtc - especi peer.j - to best make it work.
