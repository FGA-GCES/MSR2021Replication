i'm have troubl understand what this modul actual does, and whi i should use it.mi initi idea of the modul was this: it take ani website, compil the client-sid code into an electron app so that you don't need internet access to use it (except for "external" requests). much like an app for io or android, or ani other comput program.but after tri it out, i realiz you still need internet access to initi render the content, which baffl me. i mean, you could still creat an icon on your dashboard for a websit and open it (almost as easily) in chrome.so the onli "real" reason i'v come up with to use the modul is this: you make sure the environ (browser) doe not chang so that your websit perform the same on all computers.am i miss someth here? or is this modul just meant as a cool featur to make websit feel more native.
