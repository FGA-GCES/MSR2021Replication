there might be an obvious answer to the question but i just can't figur it out:currently, my setup is run local (the ids, the api and the client(s)) and work like expected.th client in my scenario is an angular app run on the user desktop use electron.net. in the identityserver4 configur i have configur the redirect uri as following: my question now is how to setup the id correct if the part are not run local on my pc but somewher else. this would mean that the angular app run on some devic i am not awar of beforehand (mean i don't know it ip address). thus i don't know the correct uri beforehand and as a result can't setup the predefin redirect uri requir by ids.
