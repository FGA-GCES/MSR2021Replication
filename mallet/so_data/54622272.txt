i have the follow repositori where i would like to get hot modul reload to work.so far i am abl to:start the appcompil the app file and run a spectron test use the compil fileswhat i'd like to achiev is to alter the webpack configur accord so that i am abl to run "npm run dev" for exampl and have the app start with hmr available.how can i achiev so with the current webpack settings?ani other answer around the subject are for react projects, which are most, beyond my understanding, or are use electron-reload, which is not actual what i am look for.whi not use vue cli?i attempt vue cli and a plugin vue-cli-electron-builder-builder, but face the follow issues:it doe not support mochasimpl spectron test take up to 30 secondsif i want to custom anything, i end up with three item or more to learn/read about (vue cli, the plugin configurations, the scaffold)electron webpacki initi use this plugin to achiev the same by follow the video here. i encount sever issues:at the time i tri this plugin (3-4 month ago), there was an error dure compil occur as it would not support the latest electron version (4.0 was recent released)when i tri to understand how to get spectron to work along, i wast hour befor realiz that i am unabl to overwrite/us the node_env variable, make it even more difficult to set condit for various environ (test, development, production).when the first issu abov was resolved, hmr wasn't work anymoredespit follow the documentation, certain webpack overrid did not seem to take effect. for instance, i ad overlay: true which did effect render the overlay on error while the app was running. but ani attempt to reduc the nois on compil has no effect. similarly, it not easi to determin how to point mocha to the right webpack config (i tri both, point at the vendor generat config, or use an extend config on root, but in vain)a per above, it turn out i spend a huge amount of time encount issu rather than proceed with the app idea. all the tool avail to make thing easier either have issu on windows, or have known issu with x version of y dependency, or just simpli add overhead that i need to learn at one point to tackl better the setup (for example, electron-webpack in itself is a tool, not just a plugin, go through the document is a must sinc it has it own concept around the project structur and configurations). i spent more time learn side tool than electron itself.hence, i would like to know how to get hmr to work on the main and render process with a basic example, where, if simpl enough, will avoid i believ the need to learn extra tool or face various issu due to version or os.requirements:electronjsvuerel fast e2e testsunit testshmr both with main and render process
