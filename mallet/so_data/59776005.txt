i am develop a desktop app with react for ui and electron.so, for now, i am fetch data from the server and save it in the state use react context api to updat the ui.i am keep the state and the function to add, remov and updat state in the render process and with ipc i am share the data between render process through main process (as it should be).but as the applic is scale i need a better approach. someth like a central state (if that a thing).p.s. can i use a databas along with the electron app if there is ani real-tim databas such as rxdb?
