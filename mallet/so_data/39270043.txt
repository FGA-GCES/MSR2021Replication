i'm use electron (v1.2.2) on window 10 and i have a big problem with one of my project :i have a script with turn into the render process and creat child process to run some special code. i need the code run insid the child process to access the dom.when the process is creat (with child_process.fork()) i send some inform use the built-in ipc channel such as the timestamp, some inform about the script which will run insid the child process...but when i tri to send an instanc of a class it doesn't work at all :i suppos that is a limit of ipc communic that can onli transmit some specif datas, but i know it possibl to send a server or a socket instanc use an ipc channel, so i don't understand whi it not possibl to transmit a document.so i was look for a way to access the dom from the child process but i didn't found ani solution.th code insid the child process need to do a lot of oper on the dom and can't use ipc communic to access it, els the perform will be too slow.so, my question is : is there ani way to access the dom from a child process ?
