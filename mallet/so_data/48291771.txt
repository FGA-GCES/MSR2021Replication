i'm write an electron app that communic with a devic via the adbkit module, and also need to pars an x509 cert. i have a function that get call when the page load to popul a field with inform about the device. the function can also be call by the user with a button. after do some work on it yesterday i notic that when the page load it would no longer be popul with the devic information, and instead i would have to click the button, in which case the function would execut normally. after a lot of debugging, what i realiz was that i had ad from request.js, it work as expected.do this make ani sense? is there such a thing as a buggi npm module? is there some kind of fundament problem with my approach? i'm plan on do a lot of work with this framework and i hate not understand this kind of behavior sinc i expect it to onli get more complex from here.
