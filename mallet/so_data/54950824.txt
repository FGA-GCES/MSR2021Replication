i'm work on an electronj applic that generat pdfs from user suppli markup. i'v been tri to recreat a particular border effect/style, and after sever day of tinker i had thought i'd nail it. css border-imag stuff isn't well documented.i should'v check the output befor i had declar success. on the right is the border as render by electron/chromium, and on the left is the pdf output from my app. both have been zoom in (mayb not to the same exact zoom).clear at some point, printtopdf raster border-image. this is in contrast to plain svg tag throughout the markup, which are appar convert to straight vector in whichev format pdf store those.th border that user of my applic will want to produc will probabl be the sort best implement as vectors. simpli reject it as an avail featur isn't an option for me.so what is to blame here, and how can i fix it? is it a matter of wait for a fix in chromium rendering, and is that even in the pipeline?cr the entir border as a singl svg imag and use css-background imag fair just as poorly, that too is raster at an annoy low resolut (though, near as i can tell, not at the same resolution). even if it worked, this is less than ideal... the same border style might be use a dozen or more time in a singl document, each with differ width and heights, wherea border-imag doe the hard work for you.if the border is suppli as an svg tag, this requir even more css trickeri to put the text content over the top of it in the correct place, and the output in the pdf look as if this interfer with select text for copying/past (though i'm less concern about this aspect).can anyon suggest a strategi for this problem?[edit] i must have miss this somehow, but if you look close at the imag on the left the corner themselv are left as vector in the pdf, onli the horizont and vertic are rasterized. i don't know if that import to understand this better or not though. i'm assum it has someth to do with have to repeat the segment to make the longer lines...
