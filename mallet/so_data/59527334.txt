i want to free up some space to load my next dataset into neo4j, but after delet a few unused, older projects, it just doesn't start up anymore. the error i get happen to be the exact error as report in this question, even though my neo4j desktop version is folder, becaus the folder size is ~400gb, approxim the same size as my datasets, so obvious my data is all in that folder.i would appreci ani help to resolv this error/issue, without have to delet all my data. i have alreadi post on neo4j github and their community, but haven't receiv ani respons yet.
