i am develop a desktop applic with electron. i have ad some item to the menu bar.sometim i open some modal form with bootstrap in the program. when these popup are open i want to disabl the menu items.i have made some research and some peopl say that the menu bar could be removed. but i do not want to creat my own html menu.and there is anoth option, mayb the best approach. disabl all the option of each dropdown menu. each menuitem has an attribute, so it can be chang in runtime.i there way to avoid drop down the menu and disabl the drop-down menu?
