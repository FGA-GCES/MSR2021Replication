i am tri use nightmarej to load a page, click a button, then take a screenshot to test. the click handler on the button request the geolocation. this is part of what i'm test for. i want the page to appear a certain way if the user grant the geoloc permission, and anoth way if they decline.th problem is that nightmar doesn't expos a method for me to intercept the permiss prompt to accept or declin it. after some research i learn that electron just hardcod this permiss to grant so there may not even be a way to set it to declined. what i'd like to do is replac electron howev when i tri this it seem like the navigator.geoloc object doesn't change. is there some other way to accomplish this goal?
