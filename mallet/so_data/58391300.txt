i am use angular with electron and current i am tri to copi a file sent from anoth comput and pass it to the electron so that it can write the file onto the current comput directory. the data i receiv in the angular is in arraybuff format shown like the pictur below (imag 1) and i am use ipc to pass it to electron to save the data into a file (for example, a png imag file)imag 1:but when i tri to write the file with the receiv arraybuffer, the file (for exampl an image) is wrong. it can't be opened. the result from the log is empti {} just like below:may i know what is wrong with the code? whi is the val in main.j log empti {} ? ani other way to write/copi file other than use bufferarray? i am not that familiar in file handl in angular and electron. although i am use imag file type as an exampl but it can be anoth file type like pdf, word or even an execut like window .ex file typethank you.
