im make an app that multipl player can connect to, but im brainstorm the best approach.im go to be use electron for the interfac and then be abl to use other comput to log in to websit to join the game with multipl players. i will use socket to connect to each player, but what i am tri to figur out is what the best approach for the interface. should i use express with electron to somehow connect to the same websit the player are on? is it possibl to make the electron app start up a server and have my websit direct to the comput that is run the electron app?or my other option was to just continu upload and download from a database, but i feel like that would not be veri efficient.
