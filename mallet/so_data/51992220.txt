i am tri to figur out a way to run a node child process in a packag electron app use electron-packager. my requir is to run this app on a machin with no node installed, so i should refer the node bundl with the electron app to run the child process. i packag the app and execut it on a machin with no node instal and i face certain issues, i tri to recreat the same issu by use a non packag app on a machin with node installed, so now i realiz this is not an issu with no node installation.i am use spawn method with env variabl electron_run_as_nod set, with process.execpath as command, but i am face this below issue.note: i am face this error even on a non packag app run on a machin with node installed. the same code work perfect fine with exec method with node command in place of process.execpath on the same machine.}
