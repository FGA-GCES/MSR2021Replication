so i have been build a cli/gui app use electron for work. i have a progress bar that need an interv to be run everi so often to refresh the progress bar. recent we want to run this in jenkin so have progress bar refresh ever 80 ms would be super anoying. i ad some code to clear the interv if a certain environ variabl was set and then for some reason the app start to hang after send http requests. the server would never receiv the request and the app would just sit there. after a lot of debug i have found that put a now it not a specif request made as the app make a lot of differ requests. ani of the request it make can hang. and they don't alway hang. about 1 in 10 time everyth will work just fine for an individu request.
