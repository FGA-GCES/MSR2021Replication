i'v a sort of task manag app which the backend is written in php and the front-end in vuejs+html+css, so my understand is that it is fair easi to bundl the front-end part into a hybrid app by someth like electron, but i also want to get rid of the server-sid interact and allow all the databas storag to take part on user computer.i can imagin a tech-savvi user be abl to easili setup laravel+mysql &amp; run the server on his or her desktop, but of course, my ultim vision is to have the whole setup process and data handl be invis to the user.i'v seen task manag that store task into file and then read and write from via electron and js, but i think, i rather stick with use a databas and besid the database, model and controllers, i think i can skip all extra futur that have that app run on a server would provide.ani suggest how to best make this happen? prefer without ad an extra languag to js+php. or if this isn't possible, what is the other altern to keep the vuejs+html+css front-end as it is but translat the php code to some other languag that can be compil for cross platform, or at least linux + macos?
