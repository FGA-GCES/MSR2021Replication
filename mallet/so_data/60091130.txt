ahoy,i have an electron app where i current manual edit an url in one of my files, depend on which environ (dev, prod, test) i wish to build for. howev i would rather like to defin that in my script so i don't have to rewrit the url everi time (e.g. electron-build -w --x64 --ia32 --test or someth like that). as far as i can tell it is possibl to have differ build file (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1109), but i can't quit figur how the setup should be, and furthermor i can't figur how to get the attribut from the build file (e.g. build/publish/url). it seem possibl to get icon and name (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/639), but not url?i'm sorri if i have miss anyth - i consid write an explicit tutori somewher onc i'v got a hang of this.thank in advanc
