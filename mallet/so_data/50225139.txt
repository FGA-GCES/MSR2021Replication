backstory: i'm creat an applic use electron and am current attempt to run a function when the comput is locked/unlocked.aft much trial and error i final manag to get the follow python code working. the code print either lock or unlock on the screen when the relev code are fired. i now need to run the python script from node js so that i can run more function when the event fire.when i run python from the consol use "python locked.py" i see the test messag printed. however, when run use node locked.j the script look like it run but never print to the console.th other thing to mention is that if i comment out the final line wtsmonitor().start() then i can see the test messag print to the node console.
