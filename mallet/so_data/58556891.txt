we are use portaudio for record audio in our electron application. as a node wrapper, we use naudiodon.th applic need to record both audio and video, but use differ sources. audio, as said, is be record with port audio, with addit app logic on top. video, on the other hand, is be record with standard mediarecord api, with it own formats, properties, and codecs.w use event onstart to track actual video start and in order to sync audio and video, we must also know the exact audio start time.problem is: we are not abl to detect that exact timestamp of audio start. what should be the correct way of do it?her is what we tried: 1. the first option is to listen to portaudio.audioio events, such as data and readable'. those are call as soon as portaudio has new data chunk, so track the veri first chunk minus it length in millisecond would result in approxim audio start. 2. the second option is to add writabl pipe to audioio, and do pretti much the same thing as with events.th issu is, that by do ani of those options, calcul start doesn't alway result in the actual timestamp of audio start. while play around with port audio it was known, that calcul timestamp is higher than it should be, as though some chunk are be buffer befor actual released.actu audio start and first chunk releas can be different, in a rang of around 50 - 500 ms with chunk length ~50ms. so chunk might buffer sometimes, and sometim they don't. is there ani way to track the actual start time of the first chunk? i wasn't abl to find ani relev info in check port audio docs.mayb there are ani other way to keep use portaudio and record video separately, but final achiev the same desir feature, of synch them together? portaudio 19.5, naudiodon 2.1.0, electron 6.0.9, node.j 12.4.0
