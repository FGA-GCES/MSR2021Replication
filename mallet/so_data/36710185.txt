i do the same thing as in this question, give data to my template, compil it and made it look like a file with i get zero error about css or js file i added, but semantic-ui is not work as you can see on screenshotwhi this is happen and how to fix it? i think it is becaus those convers into string, mayb i should use other method to compil my templates. electron-pug modul from npm seem not to get data from locals, it wait for it in promis and in that time standard loadurl load pug templat straight into window without render it. mayb i do smth wrong.
