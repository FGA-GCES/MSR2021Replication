becaus electron has two process our javasript code is not global, so i find myself send and receiv a lot of event (with a lot of differ names) to do someth that we usual do with just a callback in the same method.thi is even wors if we need to share some global var (for exampl global constants). my current approach is tri to manag the connect between main and render as a websocket, but it doe not feel so good and mayb i'm do it wrong (also i feel i'm fall in dri principl becaus i cannot creat a global event listen with ipc, i need to hardcod the event name for everi "send" and for everi "on").i'm manag the window (render process) as a view from mvc.mayb i should use the main process onli to init the main window and then do everyth (database, extern api calls, etc) from our window (renderer)? (that is, mvc all in render process, and do almost noth in main process?) what is a good design pattern to solv this two process thing from electron?
