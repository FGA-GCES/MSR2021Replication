i'm current loop over a custom protocol to pass inform into an electron app from the browser. this work great on everi browser except chrome. the below code run the protocol in an ifram that then load the data into electron.codeth abov code is pseudo code of how i'm tri to achiev this.expectationmi expect is that it will loop 5 times, and pass the data into the electron app. like mentioned, this seem to onli work with ie and firefox.actu resultswhil debug chrome, i find that it is onli execut the first page. from the look of it, for whatev reason, chrome is onli execut the first protocol load in the loop. other attemptsi'v also tri to do a timeout in the loop. think that mayb it'sjust trigger the protocol too fast, and chrome doesn't like that.that fail as well.i'v even tri just loop over javascript that creat a new tab,instead of an iframe.. and it give me the same result.do anyon know of a secur set in chrome that would prevent custom protocol to be load into chrome multipl time simultaneously?
