i'm work on desktop app base on electron (i.e. node.j and a chrome browser shell cram together), and one of it featur will includ load arbitrari video file from the local filesystem.a challeng i'm face is that i won't know the codec use by the arbitrari video files. i can filter by file extens (i.e. executables, which i can't easili bundl with my electron app. there are a million code sampl for detect which codec your browser supports. but that come from the assumpt that you'r deal with a known video file and an unknown browser. what about the reverse... when you have a guarante known browser, but an unknown video file?
