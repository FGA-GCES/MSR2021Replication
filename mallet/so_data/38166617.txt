in a blog post the author mention that electron combin node and chromium into a "singl context" which impli that we don't have to use browserifi to transform code.i understand that one implic of electron is you can build cross-platform desktop app use web technologies. i also understand the reason whi we'r abl to write to the filesystem is becaus electron has node bake in. also, the reason we'r abl to use html/css/js/devtool is becaus chromium is bake in. however, i don't think this is what the author is talk about.how doe electron to combin node and chromium into a "singl context"?whi don't have to use browserifi anymore?
