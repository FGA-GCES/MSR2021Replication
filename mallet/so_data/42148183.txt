i am build an electron base applic that contain a grid contain uniqu rows. i would like a context-menu that is specif to each row. here is an example:although this screen shot is cropped, you can see there are multipl row and each row contain separ data. sinc i'd like to right-click on a row and get a uniqu context menu, i have implement electron-context-menu, which doe work on the first right click, but then subsequ right-click caus a stack effect of context menus.specifically, here is what happens:i right click on row-1 and the proper context menu show upi right click on row-2 and a repeat of the context menu for row-1 show up then row-2 context menu show up. (notic in the screen shot the context menu show doe not correspond to the row my mous is over)thi repeat itself.in react.js, here is my listener, which collect the when i ad debug statement to the abov function, i didn't see ani output. and that is where my search his a wall.i am use electron 1.4.15. i know this issu should be resolvable, after-al the atom ide (which is electron based) doe not have this issu even though it has multipl context menus.i think there is some memori i need to clear somewhere, i just can't figur out how to clear the stack of previous context menus!
