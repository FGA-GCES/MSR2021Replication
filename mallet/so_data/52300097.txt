i have the follow code. issu is, the file isn't alway get caught by my server (host on digitalocean, not that that matter so much as i often couldn't even get it to work on my local vagrant machine).it seem to work with smaller files, smaller images, howev if i send a larger file (such as a full screen screenshot) my server is tell me that the request has been made but no imag has been found. i had a look around for a way for createreadstream to return some kind of promise, in hope that it would be as simpl as it is still tri to read the imag from the hard drive, but i'v had no luck.worth mention that the imag is be generat just befor this happens, but this is be call in a callback so that shouldn't matter.
