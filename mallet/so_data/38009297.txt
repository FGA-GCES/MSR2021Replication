i built an applic with nwjs some time ago, but now electron seem to be a solut which fit better my scopes. problem:i alreadi distribut my app and, in next releases, i would like to use electron, but when i instal it, mac osx cannot recogn the new releas as a new version of the same application.attempts:i tri to: use the same bundl identifier, bundl name, execut name;clon the info.plist, in order to have the same configur for both the releases;clon the pkginfobut none of them seem to work.on window i have an app identifi which doe the trick: i use the same in both the applic and the instal write in the right folder.i there ani kind of identifi in mac osx too?
