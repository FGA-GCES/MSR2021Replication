i'm tri for hour to make this electron speech recognit work. the follow code work in normal browser : there have been a number of question on this topic, i tri them all.her hereand here and mani more.th environ variabl setup idea is explain here.also i discov someth interest that might be relevant.when i chang the environ variabl as suggest here:but then the speech recognit stop work in the normal chrome browser.i think it overrid the default chrome key. (chrome it use googl server to do the recognition)i remov back the env variabl - chrome work again.. electron doesn't. i have bill enabl for this keys. i can't believ that everybodi fail to integr this featur in electron. speech recognit is important. i have no idea what els i should be doing. is it reli not possibl to do speech recognit in electron? then what i'm miss here..update:i see that speechrecognition.serviceuri was remov form chrome - look like this paramet was intend for implement a custom speech recognit solution. i found this thread - whi was serviceuri remov from chrome.
