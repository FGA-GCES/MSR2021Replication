for an electron project, i am use two window instances.on mainwindow &amp; anoth one for preferences. after save some prefer in the settingswindow the mainwindow should reload (simpl reload via ctrl+r / f5).mainwindow with content (a map)settingswindow with configur field like map marker color and other which will be save into a json after click event (save is alreadi working).a simpl reload of the mainwindow would be enough to load the "updated" settings. actually, the user has alway to close the whole electron app to load the updat settings.'v seen that someth like that should be possibl with the remot module. but i did not find ani exampl besid the offici doc where this scenario isn't note as far as i can see.what do i have to write into mainwindow.html &amp; settingswindow.html to forc a reload of the mainwindow out of settingswindow?
