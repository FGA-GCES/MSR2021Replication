i am a pretti new programm (wannab programm technically) and i would like to ask you guy a question about graphic tool in html5 for my project.i plan to make a planner app by use electron and the planner form should be round. this is the planner i am talk about. and i want to add event handler for each circular sector to add new or edit exist lists.so my question is, which is the proper method between canva and svg in this case? what i mean is, which method is easi to implement (or need shorter codes) and which one has faster render speed and better performance?
