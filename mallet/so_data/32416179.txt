i'm brand new to electron and i'm about to start develop of a desktop applic use electron/angularjs. the desktop applic is just go to be gui that interact with a backend server via a rest web servic and web sockets.now my question: what is the best way in electron to issu http request to the web servic and updat the ui? in normal web app i'd just interact with the web servic direct use someth like angular $http service. however, i'm unabl to do this in electron becaus the same-origin polici will block the request (from what i understand the render run in the file:// origin so i cannot communic with mysite.com).i'v come up with a coupl of potenti solutions, but they don't seem ideal:dis the same-origin polici issu by set the browserwindow prefer web-secur to false. this doe not seem like a good idea becaus if i have ani sort of cross-sit script in my ui code, then the attack can access ani file on my box.proxi all my http request through the ipc interface. the main process can then make the http request without the restrict of the same-origin policy. this just seem like overkill, though.am i miss a simpler solution?
