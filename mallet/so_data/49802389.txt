i'm make an electron project with multipl windows. one of these is a popup window that appear whenev errors/etc happen with the main window. i'm tri to write my code so that this popup window can chang it text depend on what caus it to appear.a it work previously, i defin the main browserwindow object in the main.j file, and all other browserwindow object in the index.j file. this all function as it should have. i tri use ipc render to communic to the popup window, onli i need to have a refer to it browserwindow in the same file as the ipcmain. that meant i had to move the code that initi that browserwindow from index.j to main.js. the issu is that as soon as i did so, the popup window would onli render complet blank. whi is that? if it helps, here is the code for the browserwindow i want to be abl to refer in the main file...not that the abov code work exact as intend if it place within my index.j file. it onli doesn't work when i use it in the main.j file, which is where (i think) i need it to be to refer it for the ipcmain object to send a messag to the window.
