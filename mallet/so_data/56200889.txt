i am make an applic that has a browserwindow or webview that allow the user to brows the internet. when use youtube, if you click the fullscreen button, my entir electron applic goe fullscreen. not the video, but my entir application, and then to exit fullscreen i have to use youtub fullscreen button. here is an imag of what it look like:in this imag my entir applic is in fullscreen mode. is there a way to stop this from happening? i like that the browserview itself has the youtub video in fullscreen, but i do not like that my entir applic becom fullscreen. this happen with all video with fullscreen buttons, such as twitch.-thank youedit: i found a potenti temporari fix. if i set the browserwindow option "fullscreenable" to fals so fullscreenable: false, it prevent video in browserview from bein abl to make my applic fullscreen while still fill up the browserview. i am still interest in if there is anoth way to accomplish this.
