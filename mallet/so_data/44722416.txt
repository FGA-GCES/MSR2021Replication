i'm new to stackoverflow and i was wonder if you peopl could bring some insight to my problem.if you were to develop a multiplatform desktop applic with electron to chat with your friend (in which you are abl to creat and join servers, add custom emoticons, send audios, control their desktop, etc.), would you use angular 2/4 for the client side or would that be overkill?also, regard the storage, should i store chat histori and user set in json files, or would it be a good idea to use mongodb storage?on last thing, is it a good idea to keep the server side and the client side in the same applic to allow user to creat server whenev they want?thank you, and sorri if i sound too novic there ^^
