i am use electron and node js and tri to decrypt an encrypt file use crypto js, but i don't want to save it on user local hard drive, i want to display it on video tag as i am read it, mean i don't want to use fs.createwritestream after decryption, here is what i tried:i such thing is even possible? if i want to display the video i must have it url for sourc of video tag, but i can't make an url for that file, and i cant even read it becaus it say object is pass to the fs.createreadstream and it say param must be string(path) or buffer or etc...note: the encrypt and decrypt work just fine so i ignor the rest of the code...
