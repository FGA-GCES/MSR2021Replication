in the last year i got to know that mani develop start develop desktop applic that run on the web browser.i am also tri to get into it and i'm tri to understand how i should start with such kind of development.i first thought i should creat a regular client-serv application, i.e. with apach tomcat or with php, and for each launch of an application, to launch a new server on localhost and to open a browser that will load the application.i'v late got to know that there are packag that do the server-cli work for you, such as node-webkit.i don't know where to start and i'm veri confused...when develop say that they develop desktop applic in javascript or such that run on web browser - do they probabl mean that the use node-webkit? or doe they do the complex structur i describ abov (jsp/php server on localhost) ?
