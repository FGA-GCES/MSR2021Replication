i'm veri comfort use the shell, but i don't know much about shell scripting. today i cam across a tini shell script for fix the node-webkit libudev.so.0 problem: https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/the-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0a you can see, solut one instruct to creat a shell script with the follow code in it:it doe not work. the shell script execut without ani errors, but the node-webkit applic doesn't run. instead we get the error about libudev.so.0 missing. whi is that?also, it seem like the path you add (/home/omi/nw in this case) can be anything. i tri use /home/, /home/akjfd/, and other variations, and the script alway work as expected. whi is that? (i final left it with the correct path point to where i creat the symlink)ps. a bit out of topic, i found out that creat a symlink to libudev.so.1 in the same directori (/lib64/ in fedora 18 64bit) and call it libudev.so.0 work as well without have to creat the shell script, but i would not recommend it sinc you would be pollut the /lib64/ directory, and it may caus problem in your system.
