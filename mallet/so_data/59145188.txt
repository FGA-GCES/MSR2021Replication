i have an electron app that use socket io to communic with a hardwar middlewar softwar that send imag from a camera. the camera is 4k and send imag file that are around 14 mb. the issu is whenev my electron app get a messag with this imag file (as a byte array) it lag the whole app for a second or two. this happen even if i am not do anyth with the data that is received. for example, even when the event look like this: is this just a limit of socket io? if so what would be a good altern to send larg imag files? the middlewar and electron app is hous on the same comput if that helps.
