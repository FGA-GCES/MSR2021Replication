i'm write a page scraper for a dynam web page. the page has an initi load and then load the remaind of the content after a short load time. i'v account for the load and have success scrape the html from the page, but the page doesn't load all the content at once. instead it load a specifi amount of content via get request url and then has a "get more" button on the page. my object is to click this "get more" button until all the content is load on the page. for those wondering, i don't wish to load all the content at onc via get url becaus of impact to their server.i'm stuck form the loop or iter that would allow me to repeat click on the page.&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;mi think thus far has been to use a while loop that attempt to click the button after some interv of time. if an error occurs, it like becaus the button doesn't exist. the issu i'm have is that i can't seem to get the click to work insid of a settimeout or setinterval. i believ there is some sort of scope issu but i don't know what exact is go on.if i can get the click method to work in setinterv or someth similar, the issu would be solved.thoughts?
