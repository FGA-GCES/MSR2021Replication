i'm new to electron and i am build an app that i would like to instal on windows.i read the document on how to distribut your app in electron docs, and i know about:given this, i was abl to creat a setup.ex to instal my app, but i was not abl to creat ani ui for the instal process. i want to give the option to the user to chang the instal path if he needs, show eventu licenc i want him to accept, ... no inform on this is given on the electron.atom.iolook at atom editor or slack, that are built with electron, i can see that it is possibl to show some ui dure the installation. how is this usual done?edit:i just read about windows-instal that you need to use squirrel event for thisedit edit: chang titl to "chain msi instal with electron" notic that the first time the instal launch your app, your app will see a --squirrel-firstrun flag. this allow you to do thing like show up a splash screen or present a set ui.
