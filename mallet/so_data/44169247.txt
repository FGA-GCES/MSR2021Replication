i'm develop an electron app that use spatialite.i did a simpl test on a spatialit tabl with about 52000 polygons. (can't tell how mani vertices...)run the follow queri in spatialite_gui take about 0.5 seconds.run the same queri through electron app take about 3 seconds.sql: select field1 from tabl where st_intersects(geometry, st_geomfromtext('point(x y)', 4326));ye there is an spatial index on spatialite. doe spatialit_gui load the full databas into memory? mayb that whi is much faster.ani idea about how to improv perform on electron app? thanks.
