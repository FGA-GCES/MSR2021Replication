i see that tooltip were address on the win platform in the latest releas (0.6.3) of node-webkit, but my issu relat specifici to the tooltip (text) attribut which can be assign to the gui.tray element which (on window platforms) should appear when the icon is hover over in the system tray. this doe not seem to work on either window xp or window 7. is this a known issue?thank you,jonathanupdate: i find that assign a tooltip after creation works. it is onli when a tooltip is includ in the option field at the time of creation where it fails.
