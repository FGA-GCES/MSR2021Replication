i want to handl ani api request from the web app wrap in the electron app. my intent was to keep the same api call that web app deliv over the net will stay the same as when deliv as standalon electron app. in the latter i would captur api request and serv respons creat locally. is it possible? i'm look into api but then i would have to modifi my api call which i want to intercept to use custom protocol when within electron wrapper which is not what i want (intercept request and serv custom respons on electron).
