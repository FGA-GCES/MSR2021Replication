i'm wonder if there realli isn't a singl practic solut to this problem. namely, swap html content of webpages. in this case jqueri load() isn't use becaus i have to load the file local for node-webkit which isn't work becaus cross origin request are not allow on chrome.and i just won't creat a frig localhost webserv just to load a local piec of html. basic my problem is that if i link to other html file in the menu-bar, the entir javascript reload too, that make it imposs to keep process run without interrupt in the background. if the html page reload everyth includ javascript file reload. kill the current process of node-webkit node js etc.her a piec of code just to illustr what i don't want to do. is there no simple, standart pure-javascript way to swap content local without crazi hack or extern libraries? wasn't the web design for this and isn't there a need to implement some solut for this in these day where tool like electron and nw are becom more and more popular for desktop applic development?
