i recent upgrad to v8 of angular and v7 of electron. prior to the updat the sourc tab in chrome had the follow path (webpack:// > webpack > .). after updat when i run ng build --watch and npm run electron the app open correct but now i cannot debug as the webpack:// onli show "./lib" and "webpack > bootstrap". the normal src folder and all my compon and their associ .ts file are miss from sources, though the app run correctly.chrom dev tool ssi have notic that when i do ng serv and open the localhost page the webpack:// doe show the content correctly. this make me think it might be caus by electron packag up the alreadi packag angular app, but i'm not sure.angular.json config file for the buildwithout the webpack:// file map correct i'm unabl to proper debug the project in the chrome dev tools.
