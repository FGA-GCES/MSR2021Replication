a bit of advic appreci here befor i start this. hope the question will help other newbi user of nw.js as well.i develop on a mac and i have build and deploy an html5 app use nw.js that run success on a mac.mi question is simple. can i build for window and linux whilst still work from my mac, or do i need to invest in a window machin and build it from there. ditto for linux.mi reason for ask is also becaus i read somewher that the node modul instal in the packag are not the same for each platform. i suppos you could say i have just answer my own question, but here hoping!
