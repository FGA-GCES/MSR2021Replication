our server reli on client certif to valid access. right now neither electron nor nw.js seem to support client certif yet, which prevent us from creat an applic that can connect to our server. after do some research, it seem like it should be possibl to use node-http-proxi to setup a proxi server that all of the communic go through. it look like it possibl to introduc the client certif through this method, essentially:cli request -> proxi server (add client certificate) -> server (response) -> proxi server -> clienti'm not entir sure if this is possibl or not, but that what i'm aim for. this is the code i have so far:pfx is a load in .p12 file. when i set this as the proxi server in firefox i get "secur connect failed" when attempt to reach our develop server. i'v tri a bunch of differ method with no better result and i'm not sure how to continu from this point...
