we are current build a desktop applic in node-webkit and we need to send http request to a remot server. for this we decid to use request, a http wrapper modul for node.thi work fine on all but one of our machines. the code for the download look a bit like this:so with this the result we get on my machin is this:on our network here the proxi server is 172.24.8.14 and my address is 172.24.9.130. node sent the request through the proxi server wich contact the target server. the result that is sent back is a 301 which is expected. ...and on the other machine:thi time node attempt to send the request direct to the target server. this result in the proxi block the request completely.th strang thing is that we do not specifi a proxi in our code howev the request do seem to go through the proxy...but not on the other machine.i there some reason for this? how is node somehow detect the proxi and send the request to the proxy?
