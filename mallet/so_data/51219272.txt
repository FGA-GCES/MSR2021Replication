sinc the releas of "safari app extension" i have toy around with creat safari app extens for nativ applic use xcode. now however, i'm attempt to creat an extens for an applic that was built use the electron framework.i'm wonder if this is possibl and if anyon has had ani luck accomplish this goal. i'm unsur how to go about initi the safari app extens without the use of xcode.for those unfamiliar with "safari app extension" you can add one to an exist nativ project by open a maco application, go to "file->new->target->safari extension" this will then creat the extens within your exist applic and make the extens avail within safari->preferences->extensions.thank you for reading.
