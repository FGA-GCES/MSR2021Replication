electron-render doe not load the html file includ the script after i bundl it with webpack (dist folder).image: noth loadedi am sure that i load the right file, becaus it get load if i remov the script tag place by html-webpack-plugin in the compil index.html'.i tri the same with the webpack-dev-serv and the result are differ depend on the setup.i run webpack-dev-serv first and after it start i start electron from anoth bash instanc (a new git bash window or cmd window). the result is alway an empti window like in the previous imag noth loaded.if i run webpack-dev-serv and electron from the same bash instanc like so:package.jsonelectron should load from both the file and the server. it doe neither of those and i think that the problem lie at webpack and the configs. i cant tell whi electron can load the code either fulli (dom and script) or partial (just the script) on the initi request to the webpack-dev-serv and than fail on ani subsequ reload.
