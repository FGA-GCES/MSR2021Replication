so i'd like to take advantag of modern ecmascript syntax in a project i'm developing. i'm use nw.js (https://nwjs.io/) for a server-sid nodej application. i'v got webpack setup to do the babel transpiling, and i think everyth on that side of thing is work correct and build my bundle.j file which contain the javascript code i want to reference.th problem is, i'v got the main html file for my applic and i want to refer function insid my bundle. what is the best way to access export functions? i'v tri to use requir as well as referenc module.export to refer export function in my bundle.js, but none of these seem to work. i need to be abl to have a button click event fire and then call one of the function in my bundle.i should add that i realiz i can add event listen in my bundl file itself, but i'd prefer to be abl to refer a function direct from the onclick event on my html element if possible.
