for around 3 week i'v been work on an electron app and final decid to get around to ad updat checking. for my research, the standard way to do this in electron (use squirrel) requir the user to physic instal the applic onto their computer. i would rather not do this, and keep everyth as portabl as possible. i then decid to tri make my own updat script by have the program download the update.zip, and extract it to overwrit the exist files. this work well, up until the veri end. at the veri end of the extraction, i receiv a npm packag (https://www.npmjs.com/package/unzipper).th code work perfect for all other zips, but it fail when tri to extract a zip contain an electron app.anyth i'm do wrong, or mayb a differ packag that proper support extract zip with .asar files?edit 1i just found https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-basic-updater, which doe not throw the same javascript error howev it still doe not extract the .asar file correctly, and will throw it own error. sinc the .asar is still missing, the app is still useless after the "update"
