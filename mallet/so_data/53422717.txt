everyonei creat a react app in order to build an electron app. i'm tri to use electron-build to creat the installers. i'm work on ubuntu tri to generat a .deb.i didn't use create-react-app, i use a boilerpl i alreadi had, but i don't know if this is the problem.i can make it work as long as i edit the index.html the webpack generat in the build folder. i have to chang the path to main.css and build.j from /main.css and /build.j to ./main.css and ./build.js.i read that i have to use the "homepage" properti in package.json, but it not working, seem to be ignored.mi folder structur is like:ani idea how i could make this process automatic?
