i have been play around with pouchdb (use express-pouchdb and pouchdb-find) for a while and realiz that i need to work with some stream through rxjs for my angular 5/electron app. for my current setup, i run express-pouchdb to set up a local pouchdb for persist and then in angular i have the following: express app and just call it through rxdb by rewrit my servic and refactor the code. however, i guess that i need have to call sync on everi collection.though, i would rather drop the express applic if there was a way to run with persist with rxdb directly.
