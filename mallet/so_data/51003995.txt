i built an electron app and i am now look at how to distribut it.i went with electron-build to handl packag etc.for a bit of context, as a web developer, i am use to continu deploy web app on a web server but i have a hard time figur out how to distribut a packag one in electron. in electron-build doc there is a brief mention about test auto-update: "note that in order to develop/test ui/ux of updat without packag the applic you need to have a file name dev-app-update.yml in the root of your project, which match your publish set from electron-build config (but in yaml format)"but, it rather vague...so i actual have two questions:1. how do i actual test the auto-upd flow?do i need to actual publish a new version to trigger an updat locally? seem pretti unclear, it would be like develop against the product server.2. is it possibl to have a fallback for unsign code?i don't have yet ani certif for code signing. so the os/app will block the auto-update. but, i'd still want to tell the user that an updat is avail so they can go and download the app manually. can i do that? (go back to point 1, i'd like to be abl to test this flow)
