i'm tri to wrap my head around how electron (former atom shell) works.i'm come from a traditional, mvc-style web applic where a browser is call a control action through a rout system, the control then fetch data from a store (file system, data base, ...) and render a view, which is sent back to the browser. some action may be send back json instead, as they are call through javascript/ajax instead of the browser actual navig to them.i want to creat that, but as a cross-platform desktop application. i know that atom shell combin both a chromium-brows and a node.js/v8 runtime, but i'm not sure how they would communicate.i guess i could run a full on web server (basically, some node.j http middlewar like express), but that creat a network-reach server (which might also trip up firewalls) - one of the reason i want to make a desktop app is precis to avoid run a real server. basic like the mvp/mvvm pattern in a "normal" desktop app.can someon give me a few start point for what i'm tri to do? how would the browser talk to the node runtim (the "client" as they call it?) to tell it "hey, fetch my the record with id 12345" and would the client return render html, or would the browser just get a blob of json back and render it through a javascript templat engine?
