the idea is to bundl the mysql databas within the npm app. the reason behind this is becaus the app is intend to run as a stand-alon desktop applic built use electron and, of course, mani other modules.so far, all of my search for a mysql databas modul onli lead to the drivers. all other tutori talk about the typic web app set up wherein the mysql db is instal in the server. a comment from anoth post discuss how to set up mysql db in server and just mention that if it a desktop app, it a whole other issue. i want to know if there is a way to do this or if it isn't possibl at all.
