i am work on an electron app where i'd don't control the content of the render process. for this portion of the app, i'm just brows a remot url outsid of the app.i'd like to be abl to stream the consol from that render process to the main process and detect the presenc of certain messag and act upon them in the main process.sinc i don't control the render process i can't use ipc to send messages. if i launch electron with the environ variable, i can stream the render process, but onli to the terminal. i don't know how to access that data in the main electron process. is this possibl somehow?
