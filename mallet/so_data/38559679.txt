i'v been look at solut so that i can creat a cross-platform fluid experience. so to do this for the onlin websit version, i would just send an ajax request to a php script to queri a mysql database. but i am think of creat an electron app for offlin use, so i will need to send queri to that onlin database, but i know there are a lot of limit when it come to ajax with regard to cross-sit requests.so is it possibl to send these sort of ajax request to a php script on a web server, from an electron application. but, if ajax request aren't possible, how would i achiev this type of request to an onlin database. i have tri do some research on the subject but was unabl to find ani solut that are similar to this situation.
