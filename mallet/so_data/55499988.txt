i have a typescript base electron app that i am develop in vs code. present my debug set-up is as follows:a launch configur entri for the electron launchera launch configur entri for the electron rendererth launcher debug within vs code just fine, howev the render never attaches. i can use the chrome debugg in the browser, but none of the sourcemap for the typescript work properly, the wrong line are mapped. for example, the actual break point might be on line 50, but the debugg stop at line 65.in an ideal world, i would be abl to debug typescript from within vs code. is there a way to achiev this? is there a way to get chrome to handl the sourc map proper so i can actual use the develop tool for debugging?
