i would like to gather some metric about usag for an electron-bas cross-platform desktop app. this would consist of basic inform on the user environ (os, screen size, etc) as well as the abil to track usage, for exampl track how mani time the app is open or specif action within the app.thes metric should be sent to an analyt server, so they can be view in aggregate. ideal i could host the server-sid compon myself, but would certain consid a solut host by a third party.ther are various analyt solut for the web (googl analytics, piwik), and for mobil apps, as well as solut for node.j server-sid apps. is it feasibl to adapt one of these solut for desktop electron-bas apps? how? or are there ani good analyt solut specif design for use with desktop app which work with electron / javascript?unlik a typic webpage, the user might be use the app offline, so offlin action should be recorded, queued, and sent later when the user come online. a desktop app is typic load page from the file system, not http, so the solut need to be abl to cope with that.unlik a node.j server-sid application, there could be a larg number of client rather than just a singl (or a few) server instances. analyt for a desktop app would be user-centric, wherea a server-sid node.j app might not be.eas of setup is also a big factor - an ideal solut would just have a few line of configur to gather basic metrics, then could be extend as necessari with custom actions/events.
