i am read a 1080p and 720p extern video camera stream through getusermedia api with the follow configissu -> this work fine on high end devices, but on a devic with 4gb ram, intel core i3 while record in 1080p and 720p i get lag and the video is choppi onli for first 3 seconds, but the remain video is just fine.also, on play this record video in vlc media player, the timer direct jump from 00:01 to 00:03,if this was a memory/buff issue, the other blob would be affect too. am i miss someth , should i use mediarecord in a differ way, or with ani differ options.ps: i have tri to use recordrtc by sir muaz khan, but it seem heavi for the cpu as cpu usag surg past 70% on the abov mention machin which make the machin super slow.pleas shed some light on this.
