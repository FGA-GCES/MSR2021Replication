i'm tri to build a desktop app for the first time, use the electron framework, and i'm tri to use the trilog module. however, sever error keep pop out.basically, the main idea of my code is to have a button that enter a sql databas and check whether the tabl "data" exists. (i know it kind of lame, but i'm tri to test out the concept here so bear with me).mi main.j code is just the exact code found in the beginn tutorial, and seem to be work fine befor i import trilogy. the depend portion of my package.json was as follows:, the output text in the div becom "this doesn't work". i attempt to run it on my browser, but my browser wouldn't recogn "require" and "import" (i tri use both statements), with the error messag "can't find variabl require" and "import call expect exact one argument", respectively. when the button is clicked, it then say "cannot access uniniti variable" at the line when i call the db.hasmodel() function.when i tri remov the import and requir statement, and load it straight into the html first, it output the error that "undefin is not a constructor".do anybodi have ani idea how to implement this so that i could do what i want to do? or if not, ani suggest on how to further debug this would also be welcome. thanks.
