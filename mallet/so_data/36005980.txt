edit 1 2017/01/29 - at the moment our choic has gone to electron in combin with edgej and all the power of nodej and the packages/resourc on npm there.. there is no better altern for us to creat cross platform app for all three plyer (macos, linux and windows). thank everyon for their input.origin question:tl;dr - backend code written in c# (.net/mono). write a desktop applic that need low level access to the system (cross platform osx, linux, window 7 to 10). in search of a one-stop cross platform ui tool/framework that can interfac with the status of the backend-code, either by polling/messag or call into the code of the backend code. this "backend" includ for exampl the scan &amp; list of process info, take screenshots, etc.. send network inform (which websit were visit etc..) it in essenc an exam monitor for student when they'r do an onlin exam in classrooms.**opt we are exploring:electron (former known as atom shell) look nice, but we have no idea whether it can interop/cal into/kickstart a c#/mono application. post this as well on their offici forum for feedback, and whether it is a good use case for electron. in an ideal world, we'd like to use electron fully, but unfortun i think we need platform specif logic (which now we handl in c# w/ .net &amp; mono). eto.form is what we work with now, but is limit in it ui capabilit - as sometim it still render differ (size of windows) on differ platforms. it also has a differ look &amp; feel that tie to the platform of the user - which is a good feature, but it make it difficult to make dedic control to visualis status, which would be easier in html/css.anoth route, is a mix between eto.form (or someth else) to bootstrap a nativ ui that host a browser in it window that cross platform and not depend on the local instal browsers, such as awesomium. this would still requir eto.forms, or ani other bootstrapp to kickstart the application, but all other navig would go through the awesomium render html.thanks,yv
