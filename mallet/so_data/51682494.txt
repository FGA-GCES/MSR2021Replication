i'm work on a task that requir to put an overlay over an exist browser window that display an app. the purpos of the overlay would be to draw some circl on it at specif point where in the applic load via browser window there are some object place (basic the overlay just highlight those object and give the option of removal).mi challeng is how to load that overlay and how it should look: i imagin it would be a react compon that i'm abl to load somehow (i haven't figur out this part yet) in the browser view. the idea would be to have access to the object place on the applic via ipc communication. i saw that browser view load an url but i'm not sure how to load a react compon in it (or even if it possibl to do that).anoth challeng is how to display the overlay after the app was load (bi use set bound and set background color i saw that the browser view was display and after that the applic load and is place on top of the browser view content).if you can suggest other way i can achiev this overlay effect, i'm open to suggestions, ani idea/advic is appreciated.thanks.
