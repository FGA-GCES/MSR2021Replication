i'm develop a basic app made with electron and angularjs. for this purpos i'm use the electron boilerpl (https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate) and for database, i'm use lowdb(https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).i have been abl to creat a database(json) and read it from a script. but my problem is when i want to updat and save. i can update, and the chang is reflect on the json file, but when i start the app again, the json has the same data that at the begin (it is overwritten).i think it is a problem with the build task of electron boilerplate, that alway overwrit the file. i thought that when i did the task to releas the app, it will fixes(npm run release), but not, it overwrit the json.i am load the databas so:how you can see, in copyfromappdir there is a db.json. this file is my database, but i want updat it and chang persist, but i am not be abl to do that.kind regards!
