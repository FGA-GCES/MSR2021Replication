i'm work on an angular 8 (with electron 6 and ionic 4) project and right now we are have evalu phase where we are decid whether to replac poll with sse (server-s events) or web sockets. my part of the job is to research sse.i creat small express applic which generat random number and it all work fine. the onli thing that bug me is correct way to reconnect on server error.mi implement look like this: function and it seem like it a better thing to do. do not tri to close and reconnect nor propag error to observable. just sit and wait and when the server is run again it will reconnect automatically.quest is, is this realli the best thing to do? import thing to mention is, that the fe applic communic with it own server which can't be access by anoth instanc of the app (built-in device).
