i'v creat an c++ &amp; opengl anim engin back by glx and glew, wrap in a node.j modul via swig. the goal is to use the engin insid an electron app in the browser process.th engin appear quit stable. it multi-context aware, bind the correct opengl context befor all relev operations, check for error after almost everi possibl operation, and back by a rather larg test suite.outsid of an electron app everyth is work just fine. mysteri however, simpl script that would normal work outsid of electron are fail insid an electron app in either browser or render process.symptomsanyth generat by .the action in this case are occur within the same thread. in the electron app, the context is made and immedi use in the same process; the creation of the context itself queri the version within the same method. same symptom befor and after the electron app is ready'.i'm pretti baffl by this. everyth i'm check appear to suggest the context was creat correct but it otherwis appear corrupt or dysfunctional.what go on? what els can i check?
