i'v got an electron-webpack app that i'd like to persist data local with. i'm tri to use localforage/indexeddb as my back store, but i'm run into some issu with my develop cycle. in particular, i can't seem to load data previous persist onc i fulli quit the electron app and restart it. however, reload the app via a hot modul reload works. i did some dig and it look like indexeddb creat a directori with a host:port pair everi time the app is started:and the port seem to coincid with the webpack-dev-serv be run. i'm wonder if indexeddb or localforag have ani option to circumv this name strategi in favour of a user provid one or if i should look for other storag strategi
