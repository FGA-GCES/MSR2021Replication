i have a simpl electron test applic that run an angular app in the render process. this angular app has two pages: login and account. after you log in use a usernam and password, you are redirect to the account page, where you can then log out.logincomponent. it seem like the buffer are never releas from memory. i thought that mayb the node garbag collect just need to eventu run, however, i let this applic keep run all day long and the valu are still there when creat new .dmp files. mayb i need to forc run garbag collection?whi are these buffer stay in memory?how can i proper clean this sensit data up?
