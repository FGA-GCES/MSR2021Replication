i'm build a desktop applic with electron and react and would like to know the best way to valid a compon state or whether there is a better approach to this.scenariosuppos that you have a subscription-bas applic that will display content depend on the user subscript status. the first thing a new user see is a sign in box. when success sign in, the applic will fetch the user subscript status from the database. if the user is subscribed, they will see premium content. if they are not subscribed, they will see free content.a simpl exampl of how the compon may look is as follows: compon is accurate?
