as the titl say i want my react-redux applic run with node-electron to save some data when few action fires. tri 1:so i tri nedb first but it doe not actual creat ani local databas file but onli doe save data in memori and i lose the data when i close the electron window or restart it. i initi nedb datastor in redux action file so i think that it may be call in a sub-process of main electron app or someth but i don't know how to work around this problem.tri 2:after i tri simpl json file modul with same setup, when a file save action is fire it tri to save payload to a json file with jsonfile.writefil method but it also fail here with error that "writefile" is not a method. it is work perfect with my node-express app but fail with react-electron setup.tri 3:i tri redux-persist and nedb-persist librari but i think they also save data in local storag and not actual to a file system, so they lose data after a restart...ani solut to abov 2 problem or a new way to save data on local json file or ani other offlin databas solut like nedb will work for me.
