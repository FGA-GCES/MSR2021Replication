i'd like to pars json format dataset from a web server(edit in electron renderer.j file)&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;in the red circl part, the first output is json format dataset which server sent. the second output is the result after use json.parse(data).status. the third output is the result after use json.parse(data).info. and i think var xxx = json.parse(data).info xxx is an array as it show in the third output.however, what i wanna do is to get the size, time, type, url these valu separ in each element in the array. but, as you can see, the output of console.log(hhh.info[1].time); is undefined. also, i wanna get this array length, and i just use console.log(hhh.info.length) and the result is 409 and i am confus about it. this result clarifi it is a string not an array. and i'd like to get these valu and the length of the array at the same time. what should i do? mani thanks.
