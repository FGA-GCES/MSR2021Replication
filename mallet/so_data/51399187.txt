i have an electron applic that basic a googl drive client. i am plan to use oauth 2.however, googl api requir me to regist my applic where a client_secret is generated. sinc this is a desktop application, i have my client_secret store in a server. the authent url is generat in the server and sent to the user.i'm worri that peopl can pretend to be the app and do thing on behalf of my client_secret. if someon with malici intent creat an unauthor app and send request to my server, they could theoret do malici thing on my applic behalf. is there anyth i can do to mitig this problem or is this not an issue?edit: peopl will onli access their own files. just like they would on drive.google.com (read/write/delet files)
