i'm use javascript and nw.js for my game.i use the mous cursor for target and for the gui. i want to prevent the user from click outsid of the window, with other word keep the cursor within bounds. if the user click out of bounds, the window lose focus and i paus the game (alt-tab must be allow to work).i was hope nw.js kiosk mode would help, but it doe not.ther is a thing call "pointer lock", but this wont realli help me, as i need a visibl cursor:point lock (former call mous lock) provid input method base on the movement of the mous over time (i.e., deltas), not just the absolut posit of the mous cursor. it give you access to raw mous movement, lock the target of mous event to a singl element, elimin limit on how far mous movement can go in a singl direction, and remov the cursor from view.
