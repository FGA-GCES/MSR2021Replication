the nwjs doc describ veri detail how to packag and distribut your app for everi singl os. i was wonder if it possibl to packag / distribut a nwjs app as a standalon version which is run on all support platform as a standalon (no instal required). the usecas for that would be a remov devic (usb stick) which autorun the nwjs app. therefor it should start the appropri execut (provid that autorun hasn't been disabled). a second requir to the abov usecas would be, to have as littl as possibl redund to the shipe files. therefor the html5 app itself and all media asset should be reus on all platforms.thank for all your hints!
