i'm work on a nodewebkit app that use the web audio api to record microphon data and save it to disk. i'v use the recordrtc framework, but it doesn't expos a way to stream the data to disk as the record progress (which is necessari given that the record could be longer than an hour).i can't seem to find a good way to stream the data to disk use other method either. if there is a proper way to do this, i would appreci tip on what the proper tool for the job is.however, the non-work solut i have now is:creat a scriptprocessornod with webaudio api to access the pcm datacr a readabl stream buffer (use the stream-buff module) and pipe it to a filewrit (made with the wav module) translat that data to 16 bit int in the onaudioprocess event and add them to the readabl stream so they can be writtenthi hasn't work becaus the readablestreambuff is onli pipe 20 byte at a time to the filewrit and not queue all of the byte come from the microphon for some reason.
