i am build an electron app that pull data from my server and store them local on a sqlite db. this app has an offlin mode henc i need the data store locally.in the app i need to build a treeview that has a lot of node (depend on the user config) eg: anywher between 10-1000 node total includ childrens.when i build this data i use a remot render and store the data in a cache. then when it time to build the tree i call the cach and build the dom, howev at this stage the ui just hang for a coupl of second 10-15 caus the dom is re-building. lazi load is not an option as even lazi load seem to freez on everi call to get the data and build the dom. although it freez for 1-3 secsani idea how to get over this?
