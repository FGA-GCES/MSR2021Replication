i am work on an intern tool built with electron that run various nodej and shell scripts. i want to open a default maco termin window and run a command. i am awar of and use nodej ) is not allow to run this command, and the user is prompt with "this app want to control your computer". if the user accept the dialog the command and subsequ command still just fail to open a termin window. they have to go to os security/access settings, unlock admin privileges, set the app to allow control, close the app, then re-open. then it might work.und work condit (see above) it take a pain long time for the window to show up.if termin is alreadi open (which is usual the case) it often (but not always) fail to run the command in the new window, rather it will duplic an exist tab and run the command in the origin tab, which may not work if that tab was alreadi run a command. even if it doe work this is not desirable, it should run the command in the new tab not an exist one.i there a way to open a termin window in maco from electron that avoid these problems?
