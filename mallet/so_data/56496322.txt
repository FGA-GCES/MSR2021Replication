i wanna build a vue-electron app. the app shouln't be a static build. i want to load the vue compon dynam if needed. i save my single-file-compon as .vue-fil as an attach in my pouchdb. if the app need to load the comp, it get the doc of the pouchdb entri and fetch the attachment. i onli get the blob/buff and can pars it to a string. unfortunately, vue doesn't support that kind of rendering. so my next idea would be to get the path of the leveldb and set an import statement to import the attachment. how i can get the path to the lvldb entry? ani other option to solv this?
