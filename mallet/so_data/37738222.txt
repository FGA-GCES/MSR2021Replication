i am current write a project togeth with electron, i am creat custom notif and i have basic put down the design and the anim i want. it is all work (thank god!). however, i do experi one problem. i have structur my notif app in such way that the notif window get hidden after five seconds, and it is shown whenev it get data. this works, the issu at hand is that everytim a notif pop up, the window is selected. this could be and issu if you were ingam becaus it would either minim the game itself or select the window and you'd have to select the game again if in borderless. is there anyway for me to get the notif to launch without the window itself get selected. kind of like an overlay.window spec:thank you in advance!
