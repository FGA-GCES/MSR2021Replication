i am make an electron applic that use html drag and drop function to move tab between windows. if a tab is drag onto anoth tab in a tabpan it will move it there and if the tab is drag anywher els it will creat a new window with the tab (similar to how ani modern web browser would).howev the drop event trigger in the window that has the tab drop on it not the one the tab was drag from, mean i have no way of know if the tab was drop on a tabpan or not when the user tri to drag a tab from one window tabpan to another's. this mean i cannot cancel the creation of a new window in the dragend event and the user cannot drag a tab to anoth window tabpane.i have tri clear the datatransf data after the drop event, but datatransf is protect in the dragend event so i cannot detect if the data has been clear or not. i believ send an ipc messag after a drop would be too slow and the dragend event would trigger befor the window would receiv the message. how can i detect if a drop has happen or not in the dragend event?
