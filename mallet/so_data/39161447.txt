we have one code base (react.j and hapi.js). base on that code base, we have two version of the application.on is just a normal web application, the other one is a nodewebkit(desktop) version:nw.j v0.12.3io.j v1.2.0chromium 41.0.2272.76essenti applic are the same, with slight differences. for example, web version has a user (log in) management, while the desktop doe not have. web verison use mysql, while the desktop version use sqlite. there are more differences, but it is not relev to the question :)the issu we face is a how to make a proper logger for nodewebkit version. in the web version we have implement good-consol for the hapi.js. it goe someth like this:i there a possibl to attach (when the nw version is started) log4j function to a request.server, so the code is not awar of the loggin facility?or some other idea is great appreciated.
