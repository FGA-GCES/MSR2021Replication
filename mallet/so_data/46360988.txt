im tri to make simp desktop app with electron or nw.js (not decid yet). but i see a big problem right now with databases. i need to handl someth about 1-2 million of records, so i start to search and test. sqlite look ok, it can handl it, but it hard to compil for both - nw and electron. alway some error and i give up for now.so i test nedb. fast, little, nice. after insert 200k record on nw.js, databas was never fulli loaded, and count oper was not possible. so i never have ani chanc to test it with million records. key / valu databas to much work, need sql or collect like mongodb.do you have ani idea to make fast, embed databas for nw.js/electron desktop apps?
