i am attempt to util a singl html page that fill content dynam from an sqlite database. the queri is perform through electron with knex and pass to the html page by electron. the issu is that when i logout of the user page and i log in as anoth user, the array remain from the first login screen, so it popul all the tile from the previous user as well. i believ this has to do with the promis not be resolv but i am not sure. i have attempt to fix this with various methods, one was through the append of the html array, and also by clear the div content when the logout function is called, howev i believ the issu is with the knex queri and the promise.i wish to resolv this promis so that on a new call to this same function it will return a new query.
