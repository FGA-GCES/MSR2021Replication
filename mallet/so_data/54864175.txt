i'm develop an electron app and would like the end-us to be abl to import a word document and convert it to a pdf. is there a way to do this via the command-lin with ms word on window and macos?i'v found solut that covert use libreoffic or do such as docx-pdf style conversion. of cours there are api solut but this is a no-go due to sensit documents. the requir is to convert without a chang of formatting, so the think is use ms word to covert would minimis chanc of chang (unlik docx-pdf) but also someth the end-us are more like to have instal (libreoffic is veri nich in this sector). thanks.
