i have an electron app that present a directori list to the user. when the user click a button my interfac script, interface.js, clear the contain div and send a messag to main.js. on receiv the message, main.j scan the directori into an array of filenam and return the array to interface.j as a response. interface.j use a .on method that fire when the respons is receiv and updat the contain div with the content of the array.thi is my first real attempt at use node, and as far as interfac behaviour went everyth work brilliantly! wonderful, it onli been a few hour and i'm alreadi love node!however, while debugging/stress test i print the return array within the .on method to the consol and notic some strang behaviour. the first time the user click the button, the .on method run onc (verifi by one messag to the console). the second time the user clicks, the method run twice (verifi by two messag to the console); the third time it run three time and so on.th function in main.j that scan the directori onli run onc per click, so the issu must be within inteface.js.mi code for main.j and interface.js:main.js:.
