i am read the instruct for how to packag a nw.js app and the word is a confus mess and make no sense. i highlight the contradictori word-salad parts. creat a zip file (this is built into xp, vista and 7) copi all of your file into the zip file, retain directori structur and make sure that the package.json file is in the root directori (if you make a zip file contain a folder with your stuff in it, then it not go to work) renam the file extens from .zip to .nw. by default, file extens may be hidden. you need to (press alt), go to folder option and uncheck "hide extens for known file types" to be abl to renam the zip.i there a simpl step by step instruct set for how to do this ?i look onlin and couldn't find ani for window os. the goal is to creat an execut file ( .ex ) with the innard of the applic hidden from users.i'v done it on mac befor but never windows. the way the offici document is written is just too confus and all over the place for me to understand.
