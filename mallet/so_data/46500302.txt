i'm attempt to debug electron app from visual studio 2017 (and not vscode) from scratch.i creat a consol nodej project, instal and save electron. project structure: content of however, when i click start, the electron app starts, but the debug process seem to detach itself. when i tri to manual attach the debugg to all electron process (debug -> attach to process -> choos all electron processes), the break point claim not to be hit sinc no symbol are loaded.thi is the project properti page:i there a step that i missed? sinc debug can be done on vscode, i assum it can also be done in vs2017?mani thanks.note: i did check suppress jit optim and uncheck enabl just my code.
