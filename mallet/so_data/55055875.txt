i have an internal-on electronjs/nodej desktop app in a corpor environment. user instal the app on their compani computers. the app, be electronjs, has an angular6 front-end packag with it as the renderer. we are use intern oauth authent with jwts over https for the login as well, and the backend java rest api that gets/send data for this electronj app requir valid jwts. all infrastructur is intern and within our network and the backend java rest api is host within pivot cloud foundry.th app watch for usb storag devic to be plug in (via a powershel command in electronjs), look for jpeg images, and display them (a similar look to window file explorer). it run a set of busi logic on the imag and requir that they be jpeg and have a certain lat/long locat in the metadata as well. the user then click a button to upload these imag to our java spring boot rest api where they get pass on to a 2016 ms sql databas and store as a blob.mi question is... given the fact that the user is log in with our own oauth system, jwts are requir on the rest api calls, the app is host all intern and transmit over https, onli certain user can even login to the app with the appropri ad group, and there is busi logic on the front-end electronj app to even consid upload the images...i there ani need for a virus scan of ani kind to make sure noth malici is somehow get uploaded? if so, where would this take place in the describ process?
