i have a class which read a lokij databas upon initi and save the databas in an object, wherebi a collect correspond to a name. i want to have a separ array which hold just the names. i would normal do this with object.keys(obj), but in my case that return an empti array.th code i so far have is:second edit:so when i log the barbot object from this everyth seem to be initi just fine. but when i tri to access parameters, they seem not to be the right ones. e.g. it look like it would access the protoyp of the parameters?? i includ a pictur of how the consol output look like.
