i'm tri to plan a product i'd like to build and releas on the mac app store.i have a lot of function in a go program that i'd like to use from an electron app, ideal i would like to use grpc to interfac between them. i'm concern that this will be reject by the app review process, can anyon tell me:i it allow to have your main app call a bundl go program?if it is, would i be limit to stdin/stdout (i'm concern that to use grpc my go program would have to run at startup and that may not be allowed)?i'v tri to establish the answer to the abov by read this https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/ but without experi which hope some of you have i can't be sure. i'd like to avoid invest a lot of time build it a way that will be rejected.edit/update:an updat - do some further research and thinking, i have re-read this part of the app store review guidelin "2.4.5 (iii) they may not auto-launch or have other code run automat at startup or login without consent nor spawn process that continu to run without consent after a user has quit the app.". look at it, the "other code" i would run would have consent (as part of the app bundl structure/package) and i would engin it so that it would shut when the user quit the app.i also found that an applic xcode bundl structur has this comment about the maco directory: "macos(required) contain the applic standalon execut code. typically, this directori contain onli one binari file with your applic main entri point and static link code. however, you may put other standalon execut (such as command-lin tools) in this directori as well."so, it look like my question part 1 is answer but i am still unclear on part 2 of my question.edit/upd 2:in the app sandbox entitl guid i have found this "to enabl your app to connect to a server process run on anoth machin (or on the same machine), enabl outgo network connections.to enabl open a network listen socket so that other comput can connect to your app, allow incom network connections."thi impli i could use tcp/grpc but isn't definitive... i'll continu to chase a definit answer!
