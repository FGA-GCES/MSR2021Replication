is it possibl to have regular anchor tag point to file that open a dialog for save the file? like a web browser would.for example: and it want to open the file in the applic rather than download it.update:in a later version of electron than i use when i wrote this question the behaviour is as i want it to be, a window open that ask the user to save the file.however, in the case of extern link and want to keep the electron window onli for intern link and open the extern one in the default os choice, the answer by joshua smith can do exact that.
