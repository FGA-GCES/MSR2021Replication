i'm tri to develop my extens for vsc (visual studio code).w have some applic here that have command line input when launch and we can write in there some command like in ani termin and get various results. this program support inhous program languag and with that we can modifi it in the way we need. but with standard instal we have emac as develop tool so we want to write extens to vsc. and here is a first problem!i'm tri to spawn or execfil via node child_process and i can't get work stdin stream. after program start and load it tri to get stdin and faild with some kind of error: "ascii "readfromconsole: redirect termin i/o fail last error 109".but if we start this program from cmd it work fine and we can write command into cmd.i tri when "spawn" use pipe method or ipc'. with ipc method process doesn't close but not receiv ani data with subprocess.send(). pipe method or ignor crash the app after it loaded.i hope i can get some code exampl from you, guys, that help me understand how proper work with stdin stream. it seem to me, that node.j process just close it stream after it execut the program. so mayb some code exampl how to read from console, wait for input and keep stdin aliv until my app or extens close itself.with best regards,greg.
