i'v spent 2 day tri to find a solut for store user data remot for my electron app.for simplicity, let say i have an electron todo app:aft run the app, the user is suppos to regist with email/password (ideal i want the app to send a request to the databas and see if the user exists) and onli after success login he will be abl to create/access his todos. in other words, i need to add a user in a databas and then store the user todo insid that db. all uniqu user will have their own todo and i want to store it remot on my server somewher alongsid their encrypt login/password info.i understand that electron is basic a browserwindow and theoret i should be abl to integr authent and databas with someth like passport.j and express, but hard-cod connect string for db connect insid a nativ app doesn't feel secur sinc everyon can dig into it even if you webpack it.i spent 2 whole day read docs, tut and other info tri differ approach from host api to third-parti authent servic with oauth (with kind of success, but more confuse). most becaus of a lack of experi especi with electron.it would be great if somebodi can point me in the right direct (so i can spend anoth 2 day :d) on how i can integr a remot databas with user authent and secur data storag on my server, without hard-cod sensit data.
