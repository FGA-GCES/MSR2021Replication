we have mocha+spectron test an electron app. they run for about a minut currently. the app window keep open and closing, which is annoy in a coupl of ways:if the user clicks, or type when it has focus, in the app window dure a test, it can often fail the test.each new window open up with focus, which make it hard to use ani other program.(that is the behaviour on linux, xfce desktop; i can imagin other os/window manag might have slight differ behaviour?)i there a way to run spectron test in their own desktop? mayb in anoth x session, that just run for the life of the tests? (though, ideally, look for a solut that would work on mac, and windows, too.)(i saw refer to mocha-headless, but i think that is for test websites? could it be use with spectron and electron apps?)
