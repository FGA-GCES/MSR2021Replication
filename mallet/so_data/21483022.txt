i'v been test all of my cross-origin data through node with much success. however, i recent ran into a situat where node couldn't solv the request for data.i'm use the getimagedata() function, which throw the cross-origin problem. on other cross-origin problems, node can success handl the requests, but this function seem to give it trouble. also, if i packag it up with node-webkit and run it stand-alone, it work great. i'm sure there is an explanation, but i cannot find it. whi would node-webkit work, but run a node.j server not? without pour code all over this page, let me tri to explain what i'm doing. i have an axi camera that i'm get data from. it motion jpeg, and it get store in the img tag that i'v got id'd. the data is come from http://ip, etc, etc.i think the problem is that the getimagedata() function is request from the img tag id rather than somewher external, which would in-turn throw the cross-origin flag. am i correct? how can i solv this?also, doe anyon know of a good way to test node-webkit app without actual packag them? essentially, a node-webkit simulator?
