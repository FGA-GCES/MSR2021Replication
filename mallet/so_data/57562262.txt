i'v been use handlebar with my electron app for a while and it all been work but today i decid to break a few thing out into partial to minim duplic of html in my templates. i saw in anoth stack overflow that you can regist all templat as partial by do the following:i'm guess for some reason when call the templat it use some other instanc of handlebar but i'm not sure whi it would be do that. i'm run this in an electron app so this is all take place in the render process. i'm not sure if it becaus dure recompil it doesn't know about the partial but i don't get whi it would need it there. also it doesn't error when i tri to precompil it. to precompile, i'm use gulp and gulp-handlebars.
