i'm tri to return a singl string from my server in electron/nodej and have some trouble.i have a function call handlehwcompare, which has a type and valu sent to it. with certain types, i need to send the valu to the server which will process and return a slight alter string to match some specif case in my script.th problem is, i can't figur out how to proper use the return data in the function.thi function has multipl type of returns, becaus it use for multipl purposes. here is my function: part to work, so it broke my script (i don't have the code for this anymor as i'v been tri thing for hours).it seem so difficult to do such a simpl thing, i don't want to rewrit my entir app structur just for this. how can i send this valu and retriev an alter version in my client insid this function?i'm awar of thing like await and promises, but no matter how hard i tri i can't grasp the concept on how to use them.
