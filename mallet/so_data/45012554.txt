i believ this could be relat to daylight save time but not entir sure.essenti i have a file that i share between both the render and main process. in node consol i get the same output as the main process which make sense, so i assum chromium is manag date differ to node.i guess the time differ and my inabl to explain it point to two questions:hour differ - whi is there an hour difference? is this some affect of dst? if so can the render and main process be brought into sync?second differ - whi is there also second differences? when the main and render process requir the same file they share the same cach right? so should get the exact same date and log it?ani help on the two point would be great appreciated.
