i am a new to nedb. it a kinda what sqlite is for sql communiti but for the node.j community.[https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb]i want to ask is possibl to have multipl collect in a singl databas file (datastore).if there is, could pleas show me some code sampl on how to go about it?i have tri this:however, i get a cannot call method insert of undefined. i thought that if i call the collect name (todols) when insert a record it would work so that i can proceed to add anoth collect to the datastor (db.user) but i was mistaken. hence, is it possibl to have multipl collect in a singl datastor or am i to have a datastor for each collection? if it is possible, doe anyon know how to achiev this?thank you...
