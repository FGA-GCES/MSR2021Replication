i need to creat simpl cross-platform (linux, win, osx) termin applic with node.js. i think the best and simplest way is to creat npm packag with cli script, but my app should be standalone. first i'v come to solution: for win and osx - creat instal with bundl node.j binari and for linux - creat packag with nodej as dependency, imho it too complic for ~300 loc app. current i'm use node-webkit with "window": {"show": false} in package.json and must be reconcil with complet unnecessari webkit engin packag in my app binary.mayb there is an easier way to creat cross-platform cli app with node?thank for help!
