i'v been direct to develop a web servic that present a tradit gui with various push buttons, dropdown lists, etc use node.js. i'v gone through the tutori at the node.j web site and everyth there is easi and straightforward, but it doesn't cover how to do a web site that present a basic gui.internet search point to use the electron modul for user interfaces, and youtub has a number of nice video on the subject, but they all discuss how to make standalon desktop applic for deploy to clients. i just want to do the web site/service, not a deploy desktop app. is electron still the modul to use for this? if so, is there a simpl exampl where that can point me in the right direction?
