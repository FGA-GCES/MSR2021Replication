i am tri to do a poc for video process applic with the follow stack and struck with pass process media stream from c++ applic to electron front end gui.c++ applic will read the ip/webcam(us opencv onli to fetch data) and process the input stream(not with opencv). i am tri to figur out a way to send that stream from c++ to electron gui(nodejs/js) with good fps. right now i compil my c++ app use node-gyp and instal it as node package.also, i don't want to chang my c++ applic too much( like includ opencv as node package), becaus later i will use that c++ applic alon for integr with anoth application.
