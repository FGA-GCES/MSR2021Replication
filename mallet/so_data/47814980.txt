i'm creat a 3d applic which use a node addon written in c++ to generat 3d object (vertices, normals, indic etc) which i need to pass down to my webgl window (i'm use three.js). my applic is wrap up in electron.what is the most effici way to transmit my larg data array (mi 3d object contain mani polygons) from c++ (node addon) to the render front end? ideal i would love it if i could alloc some heap memori in c++ and have it access from the render thread in electron to creat the three.j objects. is that even possible? right now i'm alloc buffer in c++, pass them down to node (main thread) via v8, and then use electron mainwindow.webcont to send this data to the render thread which can then creat my three.j object for render in webgl. this seem ineffici so i hope there is a better way.th altern that i was consid is have the c++ code creat a file, and then have the front end read the file.
