how can i chang the size and posit of dev tool in differ mode in electron? current i use simpl function in my main.j to open dev tool at app start, that basic just one line:to open my dev tool either in separ window or as part of the main app window. what i need is:for detach mode dev tool window to appear next to my app window instead of on top of it or under it. i'd like to declar it initi position.for both bottom/right and detach mode dev tool to have exact the size i need. in detach mode it would be the window size and in right/bottom mode this would be how much of the window do dev tool take. i can do all that manual after dev tool open so there has to be a way to make it start in correct posit and size from the beginning, yet i'm unabl to find out how.update: half of the question answer (mi own answer below), but for the sake of complet answer regard dev tool in "right" or "bottom" mode is still up for grabs.
