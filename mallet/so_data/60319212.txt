i'v been struggl with this for a while and still didn't find ani good solution. i am develop a window full-screen (kiosk) app and i need to have a modal window for a password to exit the app. i did the modal window and the functionality, but the problem is now that when the modal appears, the main window exit the full-screen and show the window (os) task-bar with both window (main and modal).on way to do fix this is forc the app to becom the window shell instead of explorer. i tri to do it by chang the reg. key so, doe anyon pleas have ani idea about how to: - either make the main app stay full-screen all the time, or...- make the "shell" registri key be proper enabl and keep the valu of the app.thank you veri much for everyon time and help!
