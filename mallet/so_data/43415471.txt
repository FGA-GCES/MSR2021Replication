solut such as electron requir bundl an entir browser with the result applic which use the exist browser to open itself, hide the frame / url bar of the browser, and has access to system resourc (fs, child processes, etc.)?edit: i'm think someth on the line of "bundl node.j + an html into a .app which open an exist browser (point to that html) without the url bar". node.j can then access the filesystem and communic with the app via http, ws, etc. the onli real problem here is open chrome without the url bar, i guess.
