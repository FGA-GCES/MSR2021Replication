i am develop with electron-vue. i want to read a big text file provid by a user line by line. also, i want to show a load icon dure the read (which mean the read should be asynchronous).pleas note that the text file is encod with shift-jis.at first, i tri the following:src/renderer/components/import.vu but these didn't work. when a file is provided, the file is read asynchronously, but the readfil function return complet as soon as file is provid (that is befor complet the action), so the load icon never appear. how can i achiev both of "read file with shift-ji asynchronously" and "show load icon while the file is be read" on electron-vue?pleas note that electron-vu is seem use node.j version 8.9.3.
