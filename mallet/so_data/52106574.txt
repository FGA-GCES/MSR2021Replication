i'm creat a launcher use electron. it launch applic and file in my window system use the shell.openextern command.it work well when i call shell.openextern pass .lnk shortcut as parameters, but when i call some appar equal shortcut creat by, for example, gog installers, the game is not launch and i can't debug what happens. i know that the shortcut is call but the target applic crashes. i got this messag from lichdom: battlemag launcher:witch 3 also fails, nos messag is displayed. when i call these shortcut direct from the system, they work fine. if i manual creat an appar exact same shortcut to the same file, it launch normal in both electron and the explorer.ani idea what could be happen or how to debug?
