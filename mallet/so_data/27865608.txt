i'm current build a multi-platform web applic that will be avail over the internet as a regular website, on desktop use node-webkit (node js) and also mobil use cordova. everyth use html/js, so i'll be abl to use the same code everywher (mostly), which is what i'm aim for!th applic will need to encrypt some sensibl data, and i would like to use rsa encrypt for it!th problem i'm face is that so far i haven't been abl to find a pure javascript lib abl to do it! and whi is that, you ask?! everyth i'v tri so far doesn't work on node-webkit, becaus of some uint8array, uint16array or uint32array object. apparently, v8 has some problem with those! tom wu jsbn lib use that, and sinc almost everi other javascript lib is base on tom wu's, they all have the same problem (ex. jsencrypt, etc.) or are node modul that we cannot use on a browser!of cours i can alway workaround it, detect if i'm run on node-webkit or not and use a node modul if so, and a normal lib otherwhise. but i would realli like to keep it homogeneous!what i need is:a pure javascrypt (not modular) lib that can rsa encrypt with a public key, that also work on node-webkit v8. the decript will be made onli on the backend (with c++), on the frontend i'll onli need javascript to encrypt.do anyon know someth i could use?
