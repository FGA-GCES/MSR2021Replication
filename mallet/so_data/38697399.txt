i am tri to figur out an effect way to bundl and distribut various depend (node modul and/or "client"-sid script and framework like angular) with my electron app.although the basic approach of and then use prune dure the actual app build/compilation?regardless of which method abov is used, you still end up with full npm packag in your app, inclduy all the miscellaneous/dupl file that are not use by your app. so how doe one "prune" so to speak the npm packag themselv so that onli the actual file that are be use at run-tim (like minifi scripts) get included?wil use bower for "client-side" packag (like angularj 2, bootstrap, jquery, etc.) and use npm for node modul (like fs-extra) be a better option in as far as separ of concern and eas of bundl later?could webpack be use to produc onli the need files, at least for the "cient-side", so that onli real node modul will be includ with the app, while the rest of it will be in the form of web-pack compil set of files?ani practic tip on how this bundl of depend and distribut should be accredit out in practice? gulp-scripts? web-pack scripts? project structure?thank you.
