we are develop a window applic use electron framework. this applic intend to show video stream from usb camera. we are use "navigator.mediadevices" api to access usb video streams. problem is electron applic unabl work for 4k usb video resolut and throw error.w are abl to see the video stream into electron applic but it work onli for lower resolut e.g. 480p and henc the qualiti is not up to mark. the usb camera can support till 4k resolution. however, when we suppli higher resolut it work till 720p but beyond that it give "overconstrainederror". (code snippet below for refn)
