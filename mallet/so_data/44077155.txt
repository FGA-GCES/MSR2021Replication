i'm current learn javascript / nodej / electron, and i want to build a small presenter-app to remot control powerpoint-presentations.i'v setup a server use electron like this:i'm sure that this solut is quit miserble, as i said, i'm current learn this. my question now is: this work for exact seven times. after that, i have to reload my client browser. how can i fix this? also, what would be a better solut for the requests? i'd like to have onli one app.post()-method and use the given post-paramet instead. last question: what could be a nicer method for the logging? i'd like to append content to my window instead of have to reload the whole string each time.thank you veri much!
