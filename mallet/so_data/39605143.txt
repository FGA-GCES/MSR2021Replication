i was wonder if it possibl to enable/dis cooki within the chromium plugin browser for electron.mi applic use a third parti authent and render a pop up window for it. i want to disabl the cooki when the user is authent and then re-en it after it complet sinc i onli care about the tokens. there are other reason for this that i don't want to go into with the way the app is designed. the applic use https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/session.md. it talk about how to add/get/delet cookies, but not how to disable/en it.ani advic appreciated,thanks,d
