i'm use node-powershel to run a powershel script everi 5 second to retriev the list of connect remov media drive for an electronj desktop app with angular front-end. it works...i there a way to do this without a constant run setinterval, or to simpli trigger an event when a usb device/sd card is plug in or removed? goal: the app is intend for intern window user at my company. the ui show tab for each connect drive with drive letter and details, and add or remov tab accordingly. i'm tri to see if there a "better" way of do this more effici than the setinterv and powershel script method that i current have. while it works, it feel like there could be a better way that i'm not awar of. usb-detect doesn't realli work for me sinc it usb onli and doesn't provid a drive letter.
