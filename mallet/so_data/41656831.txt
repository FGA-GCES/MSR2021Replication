i use ember in combin with electron.a the user can defin some set for the app, i thought it was a eleg idea to store the set data in local storage.for that i use ember-local-storag adapter.storing, delet and display this data work like a charm butthes set should be use in some functions, so i want to get them out of the local storage.i expect an array or json object- or even the same format as it is shown in local storage. but i onli receiv a huge abstract object ?!this is what i want to store (e.g.):&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;thi data is the base to generat an param array to use for promis for api requests.what can i do to get this in a reusabl structur ?for example:0:{record1}1:{record2}or is there even a simpler/bett way to store set made by the user after the app is closed, mayb i am miss something.thank a lot!
