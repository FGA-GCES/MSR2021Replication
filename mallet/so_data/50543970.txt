i can find a few thousand exampl of creat new window with electron, and how to chang out the current main window to a new file, but i'm realli stump when it come to be abl to smooth transit between pages.i could build all the function into the index and swap it out, but that seem over complex and load heavy.i could use one of the react bootstrap but this seem rather heavi on learn and counter intuit to electron (plus a massiv amount of mess around with multipl packag loader and other such thing i'v seen).i'v seen some thing in the doc for child window and seem someon suggest the use of those, or hidden window to pre-load content, append onto the exist page, anim then remov the old. but that just sound like a nightmar when it come to ad event listeners.i just need a way to be abl to transit nice between say a splash page and a load page, then the app pagethen say in the app transit in a modal
