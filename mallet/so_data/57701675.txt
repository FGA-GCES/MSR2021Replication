i want to find a way to fill up a tabl with data that i load at the press of a button. the data is load by process a bunch of files. each item of data take about a quarter of a second to load.currently, i'm use a function compon for the whole page and hook for state. i would like to load and render the data one by one, but when i (the user) begin loading, the app freez and i cannot click away to even x out the app. after loading, however, the app resum with the collect data.i'v tri a few differ solutions, and i'll detail the reason each of them fail.suspens or lazi loading:th idea is to load the next item as soon as it ready. these solut requir that all the data is render at the same time onc it is all loaded. i'm look for a way to render each item one at a time as they are loaded.generators/callbacks:when the button is click and the function for load data is begun, the app freez until all data is loaded.promises:i could be use it wrong. i'm under the impress that each item would requir a separ promise. i'll then have to use one of the solut abov for the whole.react useeffect:not sure how this could help the state updat and re-rend with each callback.i expect the data.length valu to increas one by one until it complet after i press the button, but instead it is frozen at 0 until the end when it chang to the correct data length. the loadthedata function provid the data one at a time into the callback function. i know the loadthedata function and other part of the code work properly. i'm just not sure how to go about concurrently/asynchron load and render the data that is loaded.
