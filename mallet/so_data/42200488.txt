i am develop an open sourc applic which should mount webdav share to local drive letter just like netdriv and webdriv use node.j and electron-js, so in my applic at present i am download all file from webdav share which take a lot of time and not reliabl for heavi data. is there ani other approach so that whenev user access a file, onli that particular file should be fetch from webdav share, i'v tri to display file meta data(dummy) structur in directori and kept that directori under file-watcher. so that when user tri to open a file then watcher should captur file open event to get which file was user tri to access, so that in background of applic a servic will trigger to fetch that particular file use file-path as reference, but none of them are unabl to captur file open event. is there ani other approach to do so, correct me if i am in wrong direction.thank
