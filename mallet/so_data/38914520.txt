i'm use to confirm a delet operation.i expect the user to close the dialog box first in order to perform some other operations.however, when the dialog box pop up the user is still abl to click other part of the window and on do so the dialog box minim automatically.i there a way to restrict a user not to do anyth els unless the dialog box is close ?note: on atom editor do the following: file -> open file , this result in a dialog box for open a file and while this dialog box is opened, the user is not abl to click on anyth on the main screen. this is the same behavior i'm look at.
