hello guy i have a question about this https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packag electron packager, as i am understood correct everyth what i'v made compil to the asar archive, and the second thing in my case packag took the product build of webpack to make .dmg file ( i am work with this boilerpl https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate). question is: i have simpl json file with dummi data, but after packag i have no idea what path to this file i should use. i'v tri to use npm modul to unpack asar archiv and see what happen insid and i didn't see anything, after i'v tri to work with extraresourc but it didn't help me at all, becaus after it compil i didn't see the file in the archive. i can't understand what i'v missed. imag work great and i don't need to chang path to them.
