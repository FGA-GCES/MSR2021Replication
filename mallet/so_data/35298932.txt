so the idea is this: build an on screen keyboard app for comput that can turn into tablet like the lenovo yoga. someth cross platform so we don't have to put up with window 10.so i'v instal nodej with electron for window manag on linux mint 17.3. i'v got the window and element all work fine, but when it come to put a keystrok into anoth applic i fall flat.mi onli idea so far is to use an extern java jar that use robot (kbm-robot nodej component) to send system wide keystrokes. first send alt and tab, then the key i want, but it take a long time (for keystrokes) and is veri unstabl (lose the correct window focus etc).ha anyon got an idea for someth more stable? linux onli solut accepted!if anyon is interest in the source, i'll happili put it up somewhere.
