i am get start with electron and have some experi with python and django. here what i am tri to achieve,cr a desktop applic use electron which will act as front-end.us python for back-end to do all the heavi lifting. by heavi lifting, i mean extens text processing.us django as bridg to show result produc by python in form of a simpl web page (i.e. electron)what i know,electron feel far more usable, effici and provid not-so-ug ui compon as against tkinter, etc. thus the choic to stick with electron.from the googl done in past few days, i know node.j has some modul to process text but realli it isn't as effici as python. moreover, sinc i am more comfort with python and the fact that i plan to play with natur languag processing, i'd like to stick with python.us django is more of a person prefer sinc i have use it befor and there is one less thing to worri about (consid electron has some learn curve).knowledg (albeit limited) i have,rodeo has done someth similar but they haven't gone into specif details. from this, all i know is it can be done. just wander around to get an answer to how'.anoth articl which talk about run a haskel server in electron. from this, i tri to adapt to django with follow implement but again i get an error connect refus which is most like due to server fail to run, is still access from web browser. keep all this in mind, i have follow questions,how to stop django server after the applic closes?currently, to spawn a child, i am use absolut path which is grossli wrong. how do i turn it into relat path and run server use the python instanc instal in virtual environ folder (venv/scripts/python in windows)?
