my motivation: i'm write an app to help with some quantifi self / time track type things. i'd like to use electron to record inform about which app i am current using.i there a way to get inform about other app in electron? can you at least pull inform about anoth app that current has focus? for instance, if the user is brows a webpag in chrome, it would be great to know that a) they'r use chrome and b) the titl of the webpag they'r viewing.dur my research i found this question:which app has the focus when a global shortcut is triggeredit look like the author there is use the nodobjc librari to get this inform on osx. in addit to ani approach other are use to solv this problem, i'm particular curious if electron itself has ani way of expos this inform without resort to outsid libraries.
