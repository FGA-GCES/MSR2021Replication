this is a beginn kind of question. i haven't use nodej before, so it a bit confus to me. i don't see a clear separ between server modul and client modules. it seem like i can use "npm" (node packag manager) to instal both client modul and server modules.mi question is specif relat to this page:http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.36.8/api/synopsis/it say that i can use node modul on client side: the render process is no differ than a normal web page, except for the extra abil to use node modules:how doe this make ani sense? node is run on the server side, how is the browser ("renderer" process as they call it) abl to use node packages?
