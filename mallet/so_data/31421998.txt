in our node js application, all api call are in server.js. it a work application, but i'm not happi with everi api written in one file i.e. server.js. mani of the exampl relat to node js application, point to write server side call in one file name app.j or server.js. to achiev code modularity, i'm plan to separ the api in differ file like employee.j (employe relat data transaction), library.j (librari relat data transaction) and so on to respect modules. not sure whether this is the right approach as node.j server need to be launch on applic invoke. so, if the api are distribut to differ file then need to check how to launch the node js server in one shot. also, we have integr node-webkit with the application.ne suggest in this regard.
