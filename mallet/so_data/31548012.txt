i am write an applic and run it with electron. as i am test and debug things, i start my applic (electron.exe) and close it everi so often (sometim mayb onc or twice per minute).aft a (seem random and definit not relat to code change) while, the follow error appear right when start the application:at this point, the applic flash one time when open but then run normally.usu not veri long after, start the applic result in the error below:at this point, the applic is frozen for a few second when open and then run appar slower than usual. as soon as this start to happen, it is also imposs to open a browser page (test chrome and ie) - page remain blank and process seem to hang:th worst is that at this point, window will not shut down properly. tri to sign out or shutdown result in a blue screen with the cursor stuck with the "loading" icon forever. the onli solut from there is to forc the comput to shut down by hold the power button. when do this, i had about 50% chanc of have window stuck in an infinit repair loop, with no other choic than to do a system restore.so now i learn that i must reboot window as soon as those gl_invalid_oper happen...would that be an issu with my comput in particular (i am not abl to test on anoth comput for anoth 2 weeks) or someth with electron?also, on a side note, mayb relat or mayb not, sometim the applic seem to start 2 render process instead of 1 - at least the log show the "render process started" twice.thank
