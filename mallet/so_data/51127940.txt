i know my titl sound crazy, as right now the popular practic is to use someth like electron or nw.js for desktop applic written use web stack technologies, but here whi i'm search for altern desktop web runtim solutions:i need to minim the mainten of both a desktop app and web app that both behav identically, ideal by consolid the code as much as possibl into a singl repository.but the desktop app can't run use chromium-back electron or nw.js becaus it absolut must run on cento 6, which isn't offici support by either (and i'v suffici beaten my head against the wall trying).so, to minim code path and maxim compatibility, my option appear to be:wait 2.5 year for cento 6 mainten updat eol (hope forc custom migration)g up and deal with maintain both a java gui and web app as separ code entirely.re-purpos my web server for local desktop execution, so that it serv the same html/css/javascript but for access on localhost in whatev browser local installed.us javafx and reus (at least some of?) my javascript/css code insid a webview gui element.ha anyon els tri to bridg this gap to consolid desktop app and web app when unfortun electron/nw.j aren't viable? or doe the simplif i'm search for simpli not exist?
