i'm implement a polym app in a node-webkit window (v0.11.2, base of node v0.11.13 and chromium 38.0.2125.104).the app must upload file (to a node.j server) and show the upload progress in a "paper-progress" component. i'v put the progress valu in a properti to updat the paper-progress component.th upload process is done by a nodej class (in the exampl below: "uploader" var) that call an event "refresh" for each data chunk uploaded.th problem is that the browser (chromium in node-webkit) render the paper-progress valu veri slow (in my comput less than 1 time/sec). if i execut ani action within the browser, it updat the compon faster. for instance: it is veri fast to updat the compon valu if i move the mous insid the window, and it is less fast if i add an console.log.platform.flush() doesn't work to render/upd the new valu in the component. it seem like the browser refresh himself when there are some free resourc avail to him (in my comput it refresh everi 1 second). i want a smooth motion so i must to tell the compon to refresh himself somehow.th code below is the simplifi version of my code:do you have you ani idea about?thank
