i have two functions. one that make a call to ipcmain and one that is parent to that function. the ipcmain call get some data from the databas and return it. the idea is to have these call organ within a service.mi issu is someth is not fire correct and i am not sure where my issu is.if i consol log the result, it correct logs, however, the log from the parent call first and log the eventemitt object.how can i get these to fire in order and the result from the call to ipcmain availab outsid this function?i have alreadi tri assign the result to a variabl at the top of the function and then return that after the call, however, the result are exact the same.i have also tri convert both function to async await with no results.mi hunch is that the "backend" ipcmain.on() function is not send a promis and therefor the parent log is occur befor the valu is set.expect results:both consol log output the array of databas namesactu results:par function consol log eventemitt and the consol log from ipcmain call log the array of databases.
