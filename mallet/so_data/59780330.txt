i'm new to electron, and work on tri to get react/typescript with hook and applicationcontext to all come together. i didn't creat the framework and i need to learn how to make this work. just set the context to avoid answer like, use redux instead. :)i have a function stateless compon that is a form. it need to be stateless so i have access to valu that are held in applicationcontext. i'm tri to render extra input field on button click, and so far when i click the button electron call the method, and then re-renders. i have search high and low, and have been bang my head on this for a few hours. i apolog in advanc if there is alreadi an answer out there.so far the code that display the button look as such:th print statement is get to the console, and then electron re-renders. the rest of the compon method are called, and are behav in a predict way. i'm realli confus as to whi this particular action is caus renders. if anyon can point me in the direct of an answer, or point out where i am do someth dumb in my code, i would be veri much grateful.
