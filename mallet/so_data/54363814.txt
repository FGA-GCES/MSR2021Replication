i am work on a script that is instal my applic made in electron and so far all seem to be work fine. there is one problem however, i was abl to add new custom page, but it is ad befor the instal is take place. it is a problem becaus this page contain two input field which user must fill and then the provid data is store in directori where app is installed. but becaus app is instal after this step, directori get overwritten and file is gone. this is the code:so yes the best would be to have this page after the installation, not before. thank you for all the directions, i am total new to nsis so i have no clue how to accomplish this.
