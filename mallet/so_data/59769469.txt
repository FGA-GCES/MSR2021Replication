hello i'm tri to get access to a usb stick from an electron applic written in reactjs. sinc electron is a googl chromium i thought i can use the usb web-api: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/usbso i creat a compon like this:but i want to list the devic avail so the user can choos between. so mayb i didn't understand some part of the doc or what is caus problem here?update:when i run this app insid my default chrome browser i get the dialogu to choos between the usb devices. so it look like this error is more relat to electron itself.
