i was watch bret victor talk "invent on principle" the other night and decid to tri and build the real time javascript editor he demoed. you can see it in action at 18:05 when he implement binari search.it doesn't look like he ever releas such an editor, but regardless, i thought i could learn a lot build one like it.her what i have so farwhat it can current do:keep track of variabl and their valu (if assign as literals)print them on the same line on the rightshow pars errorsi'm use electron and angular to build the app, so it a desktop app for osx, but written in javascript and html.for parsing, i'm use acorn. so far it a fantast parser, but it realli hard to actual run the code after it been parsed. permit onli liter assign such as the whole thing, sinc it could be danger and there probabl better way to do it.ideally, i could find a safe way to evalu the code on the left and keep track of all the variabl somehow. unfortunately, my research indic that there is no access to privat variabl in javascript, so i'm hope i can count on fellow develop ingenu to help me with this. ani hint on how to do this better/easi than with acorn would be great appreciated.if you need it, my code base is here: https://github.com/dchacke/nasherai
