i want to be abl to prompt user that visit our site to download our electron app of it is not already. i basic just need a way to ping electron to see if the process is running. ideal i'm just look a specif file insid the electron app would be great and then just access it via a port. example, i'v look into express to see if i could packag express with electron and just have electron run a separ express app, but i feel like this is way too complic just to have an electron page access via url.ar there ani other options?so far the idea is to ajax the url i want to creat above.. if it exist then don't prompt. if it doe not exist... run our protocol to launch the applic and then ajax the url again to see if it exists.. if it still doe not, display the dialog to instal the application.
