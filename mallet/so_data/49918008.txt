i am work on a project, where my applic need to generat a report. so i search for the librari that generat report for me and i got "jsreport". then i start to dig that to get dirt with that. now, my requir is that the applic which i'm gonna develop has to be stand alone, but as per my understand with jsreport, it need a server to generat a report(i.e. my applic has to communic with the server of jsreport to generat the report), but my applic has to work offline. so i am worri about it.i there a way to make it work offlin without ani server? if so, pleas help me to come-out of this. or pleas suggest me a good report generat librari that will satisfi my requirements.note: my applic gonna be with nodej and electronjs, so pleas suggest the librari relat to those languages.thank in advance!
