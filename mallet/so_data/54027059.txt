i am work on an electron applic where i face issu of block of render process due to main process access oper in dll (use node-ffi) creat from golang application.thes dll method are call in a sequenc and some method of dll has to be execut in order for the other method to work.to make these execut call in main process not block the renderer, i have use "electron-remote" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-remote) which can creat separ process (use requiretaskpool). so, in main process i instanti the node-ffi object from the dll and execut certain method from the ffi object.but in the new process creat use task pool of electron-remote, the dll'd ffi is a new instance. also, if we pass dll object as an argument to new process creat use electron-remote, we have an empti dll (no object properties).i am a newbi to concurr process in nodejs. is there ani way we can get to use the same instanc of the ffi object creat from dll in the main process of the electron applic in other process fork use child process or electron-remote?
