i'v seen similar question but no real solut that work for me yet (most user just reinstal fiber or meteor (i'm not use meteor)).i'v ad the nodej modul sync to my nodej 0.12.6 project. it depend is the fiber modul that got instal automat with sync. now i want to load sync via require, but it fail with the messag ... /win32-x64-v8-4.3/fibers.nod not found and it correct: in sync/node_modules/fibers/bin/ is no directori name win32-x64-v8-4.3, onli win32-x64-v8-4.2 and renam didn't solv the problem (would have been too easy)... how can i solv this problem? how can this happen? what is the mean of the last number (4.3)? i guess it windows, 64bit, javascript v8 engine, and then? fiber version?ani idea or hints? update:i tri to updgrad node to 0.12.6, but noth changed.i found out what the 4.3 is about, it the v8 version. well, when run my applic with electron, it is v8: 4.3.61.21'. when check the version with node, it is 3.28. so it mayb electron "fault"?upd #2:okay i found out that electron is base on io.j and not node. that explain the differ v8 versions. but still no solution. when instal fiber with latest io.j (2.3.3), it test the 4.2 binary, but electron requir 4.3 :(updat #3:even with the same io.j version 2.3.1 as electron, it doe onli instal the 4.2 binary.upd #4:now, i'v tri all three way describ at http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.27.0/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/ (with electron version 0.29.1) - still no solution. there aren't ani binari for v8-4.3, still onli the v8-4.2 ones. :(solution:se my answer below. :)
