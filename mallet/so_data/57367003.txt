i am work on a project use electron and electron-builder. i have implement deeplink protocol in my package.json file. after remov the app on window the deeplink protocol still persists. i need this to not persist. i have tried:1) delet my %appdata%\program folder as-well2) restart my pc after uninstallation. 3) clear my browser cache. after uninstal my program, the deeplink still work (it doe not launch the app becaus it obvious has been uninstalled, but a prompt still appear attempt to launch nothing). i suspect that someth remain within my window registry. note: this problem doe not occur on maco
