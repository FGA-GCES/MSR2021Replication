i want to test a web applic with the selenium framework use java. when i test the applic use selenium with chrome and selenium with an electron wrapper (as describ here: test electron applic with org.openqa.selenium in a java environ (intellij)), the behavior between the two solut is different.in specific, modal alert are correct close use selenium with chrome but they somehow remain open use selenium with electron. when i use selenium with electron, they don't even seem to be modal - i can simpli interact programmat (not manually) with the rest of the web application. when i open the electron applic manual the alert are modal.i use the follow (veri experimental) minimum work java code snippet to test the applic (i can't share much detail regard the applic itself though as it doesn't belong to me):
