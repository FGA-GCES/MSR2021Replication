i'm save some data insid an http.get in node-webkit on a mac. i notic that the target files stay at 0 byte in finder until the file is closed. i can setup a readablestream and read from the file i'm just write to and the data is there, so i'm guess it buffer in memori or someth ... which is bad, becaus i'm download larg files. ani idea how to forc it to flush to the file regularly?below is rough what i'm trying:it onli seem to get backed-up and need to paus everi onc in a while ... so whi aren't i see the files or last-modifi change?if i close the app whilst it download befor close the stream it updat at that point, so i'm wonder if it someth that happen in the mac kernel itself and not in node-webkit.
