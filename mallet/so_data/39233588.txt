i'm look to add a layer of protect to my client side code for a project i'm building. offlin mode is a huge must for this project, so there a lot of code i simpli can't port to the server. the result is a good bit of sensit code on the client side that i'd like to avoid leav out in the open. i'v look into the possibl of asar archives, webpack + uglify, googl closur compiler, and yui compressor (among others), but with es6 and react in the mix, it seem to complic thing a bit. ani advice/suggest would be a huge help. the more secur the better. thank in advance!
