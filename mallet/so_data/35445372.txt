i am attempt to build ibm_db for use in an electron app.build environ is window 7, 64 bit, use msvs 2015.base node version is 4.2.6, electron version 0.35.4 (ibm_db doesn't work with node 5.x on window 7, and this is the most recent elctron version use 4.x).i have instal the cli driver for ibm data server client v 10.5build with node-gyp give me the follow error output:ani thoughts?--edit--addit info -i'v discov that if i steal the osx clidriv files, and build with those isntead, i don't get the build error.th modul doesn't actual function though, it fail with a "[microsoft][odbc driver manager] function sequenc error" prior to success establish a when attempt to connect with a known valid connect string.i guess that sort of expected.i then proceed to replac all of the includ file use the one from my from my ibm\sqllib directory, one at a time and kept rebuild until i could reproduc the build error.it kept up precis the same behavior until i final got around to replac "sqlsystem.h", which caus the build error to issu again.i tri dif both sqlsystem.h file to see if there was anyth that made sense, but, alas, my c++ knowledg is basic nil, so, i'm at a loss as to explain ani of this.
