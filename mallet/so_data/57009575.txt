i am develop a video player application, which play video video (.mp4) from the local filesystem use node.j and electron (therefor i am use chromium html5 video player).play video video larger than 2gb seem to be a problem with my current approach. i use to read the local video file use fs.readfilesync and pass that blob to the video player, like in this code:i believ the solut is to pass a readstream to the html5 video player use fs.readstream(). unfortun i cannot find ani document on how to pass this stream to the video player.
