i am use sqlite as my databas for an offlin app which is made in electron.for creat the database, i was use knex migrations.problem is, it will run fine in development, i would migrat the databas and start the electron process.but while packag the app for product build, i need the migrat to run on the client machin on the first start up. so that the databas would be creat and when there is an applic update, a new migrat would keep the databas updated. what is the appropri approach for this. how do i run the migrat on app start up, or how do i keep the migrat in the bundle.won't all the code be kept in app.asar? will the migrat code be run from there? also, where should the databas be creat in the client machine?
