thank to anoth member on stackoverflow i was abl to use serialport in an electron app. now on the next issue.i have a compon in angular that i would like to have a dropdown to select a serialport to connect to. but i am tri to figur out how the serialport.list() works.app.component.tsresultif you look at the comment code block, you'll notic i tri to push each port into comports. but this give an error state that comport is undefined. which is weird becaus i assum that the scope isn't lost here.i would to specif grab those two port and push them into my comport so that i can make a dropdown so a user could select the arduino to connect to.cheers,
