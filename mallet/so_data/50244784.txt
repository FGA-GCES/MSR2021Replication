i have an electron app that run a program and captur stdout when data arrives.i'm tri to display the content of this output in an html pre element.i can creat a variable, and keep append the output data as i receiv it to accomplish this.i'm wonder if there a better way to do this with vuejs? instead of build a string and have vue render the variabl like:would there be a way to just direct append the data as i receiv it. so, ideally, outputbuff would contain the new data come in and i could append it to the pre element, like use .innerhtml in a comput properti maybe.
