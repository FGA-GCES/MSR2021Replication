the question look veri vague, but this is my observation.i have a portabl electron app (packag use electron-builder) and it prompt a firewal secur alert when it is run for the veri first time on a user comput (app creat a folder under $temp folder, folder name doesn't chang on subsequ runs).sinc the user doesn't have admin privileges, user as no option but cancel the "allow access" dialog. even befor i interact with the firewal popup, i can see the firewal rule added. the rule has onli the and i don't believ even that would be allow in my organization.if there is some way to programat get the handl of the firewal secur alert and click "cancel" that would serv my purpose.i know all this look like a big secur issu but if there is a way to overcom this and if there is an explan for the rule be ad when i run the app, it would realli be helpful.
