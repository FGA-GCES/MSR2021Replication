i'm build an electron app in which you can select a folder on the file system contain some other code, and the electron app use the typescript compil api to build the applic in the select folder and then dynam import it.in my app.component.t (render process):i would like the abil to debug this dynam load program, howev i need the render process and ui to stay responsive. some context: the dynam program is a trade strategy, and the render process display charting, so i need the chart to be usabl even if i put a breakpoint in the strategy.if i open devtool in the render process and put a breakpoint in the dynam load program, when the breakpoint get hit, the chart ui becom unrespons due to be paused.to get around this, after i compil in the main render process, i spawn a new window and dynam load the program there. then i have the window communic use ipc messages. this work for the most part, but is not ideal sinc serial of data dure communic between the window make it hard to maintain the state of the chart in the main process base on code run in the new window.i there ani better way to do this?th main requir is be abl to put a breakpoint in a dynam load program without freez the ui of main app. edit: just discov ndb. is this a suitabl tool? will it solv my issu or will it have the same problem as my solutoin. some guidanc specif to my situat would helpif i have my main process run with the dynam load script in memory, would it be possibl to use ndb to attach to the main process and put a breakpoint in the dynam load script? it appear this way the debugg (ndb) wil be a separ process (so wont freez ui), but would be access the dynam script load in the main process? or would put a breakpoint in the dynam load script via ndb still freez my chart in the render process?
