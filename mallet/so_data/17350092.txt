the client is tri to figur out whether they'd like to go with a node-webkit app with angularjs, but their one stick point is that they'd like to be abl for their user to drag a file out of the app and onto the desktop or an email client (such as outlook or lotusnotes) like you can do with an applet (which i'm desper tri to avoid).a far as i can tell, this doesn't look possible, but i'm not well vers yet with the latest stuff you can do with html5 and chrome specifically. ani guidanc is great appreciated.edit: i'v also never use node.j
