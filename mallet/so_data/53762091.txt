the below is also with refer to access an sdk that is written in c++ use node.jsw have a devic that can scan document/barcode/qrcod and give output via usb. the devic manufactur have given one sdk that is written onli in csharp, c++, java. now we have decid to go for, access c++ code from node. after a multipl hour of pain i was abl to run this c++ code and it was happen to be a consol applic which will print the scan document data in consol and save scan document in a particular location. now the requir is, whatev the devic do with the c++ code we need to do it from node as well except print it in consol instead we have to display it in our web app develop use angular. there are few solut i found in internet like, napi and c++ addon by node, swig for creat wrapper class. i'm bit confus here on how to proceed becaus i have no idea on how both the abov suggest way will work or is even feasibl for the mention requirement. and also i want make use of the sdk provid by the devic manufactur as it hold all/most of the featur of the device.to sum up the abov lengthi requirement:i have a c++ sdk that communic with the devic and i want make useof this c++ code to access from the node.js, how can i proceed? ifi'm go with the ani of the abov mention way, do i need torewrit the c++ code to access from node.j c++ sdk provid by the devic manufacturer, if you want to havea look. it has c++, csharp, java but we can concentr on c++all the code in the abov mention link is subject to copyright by devic manufacturer. i do not hold ani claim on that
