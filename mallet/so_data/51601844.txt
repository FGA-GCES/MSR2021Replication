i am tri to packag my electron app, which is basic two npm directori one insid other. the intern npm directori is my electron app and it make use of the outer directori scripts. my intern package.json file which is associ with electron app is where i defin my electron-packag scripts. i have a question here, i have given my sourc file for the packag as . which mean present directory, doe this also consid the file in the outer directory? i tri this and my app is work fine for now, but i doubt if somewher someth can go wrong if i am not do this properly. if this is not the proper way how can i tell electron-packag to consid file outsid of the current directory? or doe it automat consid all the requir file and script irrespect of their path while packaging?
