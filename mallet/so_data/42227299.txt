here the situation. i have creat an applic use nw.js, which is great becaus i like use html, css and javascript. howev now i would like to sell this application. what i'd like to do is make a small wrapper applic in objective-c that will verifi the user serial number and provid some level of copi protection. in my mind i imagin have an applic that would be in objective-c. that would start and verifi the user, then if the user was legitim it would unpack some essenti file into the nw.js bundl and start that application. now the nw.js execut is alreadi in an applic package, what i'd like to do is nest that packag insid the objective-c one and then run it at the appropri time. can anyon advis on whether this is possibl and if not how els i could approach the problem to secur my application.thank for ani help.
