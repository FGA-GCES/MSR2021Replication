bit of a newbi with electron and learn from some youtub vid and a udemi course.i have a coupl of sampl app up and run - so far so good, but my question is this:now that i'm start to consid the design/structur i would use for a much larger, more meaning applic i want to move all my menus into a sourc folder like menutempl and in that folder i would probabl need between 10-15 differ menu structur to be stored.insid each file i would expect to be abl to put structur like:in other words, i just want to put the json document which defin the menus into someth like:menutemplates/menumain.jsmenutemplates/browseforfilemodel,jsmenutemplates/editurl.jswher each file contain the correct menu depend on where the user is in the app and what they are tri to do.could someon point me in the right direct for how to achiev this? should each of those .js file be a module? if so what and how to export the json?i wish that menu.buildfromtemplate() would just accept a path. that would make life so much simpler.thanks!
