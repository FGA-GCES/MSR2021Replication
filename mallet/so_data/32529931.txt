i'v been use fluid app (os x) in the past to creat standalon desktop app of specif web app i want separ from the browser, have their own dock icon, and not have ani of the regular browser fluff (toolbar, address bar, etc.). fluid app, though, has been neglect for a long time and certain newer web app (e.g. inbox from google) complet fail to load in it.so i'm look for a simpl way to creat a desktop app that will have a singl window load a singl website, and i think that nw.js would be ideal for that.what should be the configur process for build such a simpl desktop app for just a webview for a given url, use nw.js?
