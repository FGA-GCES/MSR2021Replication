we are use atom electron to run an app in a "kiosk" type setting, we have 4 webcam devic connect to the physic computer, we want specif 1 of those to be use for webrtc insid of the electron browser, then other 3 we use some c code to captur still frames. we know the usb path or the /dev/video{#} for the devic we want.i there a way to either disabl access by the view layer to the 3 webcam in node befor we launch the electron window? or anoth option is to set the default camera befor we launch the view layer so that it will default to the webcam we want. in the view layer we can get a list of devic and see if they are audio or video, but we can't get their /dev/video# or their usb path to figur out which one is the target webrtc cam, so this has not been veri help yet.ani help is great, i feel weird for have to post a question sinc for the last 12 year i have been abl to find what i need by searching, but it been about 3 hour so it time to ask for help.
