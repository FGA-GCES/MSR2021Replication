i current have an app built use electron that has the follow applic menu:if you have voic over on, these item are access on a mac out of the box via the shortcut ctrl+option+m'. however, in windows, they are not access out of the box. it is imposs for me to get to it by just use the keyboard. the window shortcut to access the applic menu is alt'. when you hit tab, most applic will give you a hint of what letter you have to press next to get to that menu item. for instance, to get to the file menu itm you can do alt+f', for view you can do alt+v and so forth. how do i go about implement this behavior for an electron app?
