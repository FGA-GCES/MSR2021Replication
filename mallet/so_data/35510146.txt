i have a problem wherebi my html applic navig to the content the user would drag and drop onto it. for example, drop a text file on the applic would caus the page to navig to it.i have solv this by regist an event handler on the document and attach to dragenter, dragover, dragleave, and drop events. in the handler, i call preventdefault and stoppropagation, which work well when anyth is drop that doesn't match an expect (and handled) file type.th problem is the user can drop onto a vertic scrollbar (bi accid or otherwise) and the handler is not hit. i assum this is becaus the scrollbar isn't relat to the document object in the same way a differ child is.how can i prevent a file drop on a vertic scroll bar from navigating???https://jsfiddle.net/mcoe6e9d/cr a fiddl to show the problem. resiz the preview pane until a scrollbar appear then drag and drop and file on the bar. the page will navigate. if you drop it anywher els on the preview pane, it won't.
