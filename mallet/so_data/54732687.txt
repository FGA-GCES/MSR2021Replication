i am tri to debug a node add-on that is call within an electron applic but i can not find a way to launch or attach an c debugg to the app. i have had success in debug it when it call by a simpl node application, by call node when launch the debugger, pass the js file as an argument (i use this tutorial: https://medium.com/@atulanand94/debugging-nodejs-c-addons-using-vs-code-27e9940fc3ad). is there a way to launch the electron executable, pass the main code (index.js) of the app in a similar way?
