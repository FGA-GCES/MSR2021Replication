i have an electron app that act as a tool to speed up game development. when a user open the app they can begin import asset and set custom properties. i store these properti in nedb. the way i have my applic set up, everi page chang the properti from nedb are fetch and are immedi reflect on the page. i need to save these chang in a file the app can load and it would be intuit to use nedb sinc it load databas info from a file option out of the box. howev in the instanc a user open my app and begin work without a file, i have no way to store these chang for later use. i have found no doc for export the databas on the fly.
