i'm use electron v2.0.8, node v8.9.3, npm 6.4.1. i'v creat a simpl "hello world" program use html, css, js alongwith npm. the program work realli fine when i . but the button function as supposed. ("clear the text field")i suspect this has someth to do with the file path or something, but be new to this whole framework, i have no clue. i don't know whether my whole "creat an .ex approach" is 100% correct or not. i'v tri with electron-forg but it gave so mani error so i gave up on it and switch to electron-packag instead. none of the onlin help work for me(i believ due to differ versions) someon pleas help.
