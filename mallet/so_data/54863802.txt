i had been success debug my angular app in chrome via chrome debugg extens with automat creat settings. but [something] happened, and after one of my window 7 reboot i got unact breakpoints. i suppos that it was affect by window path environ variabl change. whi i think so? i got a messag like "path has a bad value, do you want to fix it?" when window started. unfortun i can't reproduc my old path value. it can be a coincidence, but after this case debug doe not work.no matter where a breakpoint are set: neither in the begin of function or code block, nor in the middl of block, nor in a variabl declaration, nor a variabl operations. breakpoint is not activ in noon of angular components: neither root component, nor others.i use googl chrome latest version.interestingly, i instal the debugg for electron extension, which also start up successfully, but the breakpoint are still not activated.oth info:launch.json:upd 2:reinstal window not help too. i guess the problem in the packag versions.
