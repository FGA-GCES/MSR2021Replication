i have an electron react app that i play audio file use the javascript audio element. i have someth like below. however, even though i can confirm that the audio file in local disk chang after pipe, the audio that play through applic won't be updat for around 30 seconds.so, i was wonder if there is some sort of cach mechan due to electron or node, that grab the same file from cach without check if file content is different.i'v tri disabl cach on electron chrome debugg network tab which didn't work.oth audio player npm modul also seem to work the same way.alternatively, i could just append some kind of number to the file name whenev a new file is pipe with the same name and grab the most recent while clear the old ones.but i'd rather have uniqu file for each filename.
