i'v got an electron applic that i'v packag use electron-builder. when i creat a 64-bit instal and the applic is instal to the program file folder, i can load a background imag for a div just fine from the program files\path\to\app\assets\imag folder.however, if i packag the applic for 32-bit machin and it get instal to the program file (x86) path, the exact same imag in the new locat program file (x86)\path\to\app\assets\imag will not load. there is no error thrown and everyth els work fine. the imag is set as a background style of a div use url('path\to\file'). when packag for 32-bit there are zero code changes, i simpli chang the package.json build properti for electron-build to onli packag the 32-bit version. i'm run it on a 64-bit machin right now and do not have an actual 32-bit machin to test on. if i take the instal 32-bit applic and simpli copi the file to the program file folder, then it magic work again so it seem it has to do with the folder locat specif be in the x86 version of program files'.for the life of me i am unsur where to start to debug someth like this and whi it might be happening.
