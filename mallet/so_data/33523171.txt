i'm just get start with electron, with prior experi with node-webkit (nw.js).in nw.js, i was abl to creat ifram and then access the dom of said ifram in order to grab thing like the title, favicon, &amp;c. when i pick up electron a few day ago to port my nw.js app to it, i saw advic to use webview instead of iframes, simpli becaus they were better. now, the function i mention abov was relat easi to do in nw.js, but i don't know how to do it in electron (and exampl are slim to none). can anyon help?also, i have back/forward button for my webview (and i intend on have more than one). i saw in the document that i could call function for do so on a webview, but noth i have tri work either (and, i haven't found exampl of them be use in the wild).
