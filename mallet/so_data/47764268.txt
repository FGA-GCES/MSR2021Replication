i would like to display spectron test result in teamcity. i have follow the instruct at the webdriverio teamciti report page, which are:thi test project is built with typescript and jest, and onli compris the e2e spectron test for an electron app. the build artifact for that app is a teamciti depend for my test build'. in my build, teamciti instal the app, run the spectron test (which are passing), and then uninstal the app.al i can see at the moment is the jest consol output within the build log. while there are some hidden artifacts, i see no normal artifacts. i was think that the report packag should have produc an html artifact. how do i go about display a test tab, or some other use set of results?
