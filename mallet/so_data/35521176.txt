i'm tri to do someth i thought would be simple. i'm use nwjs (former call node-webkit) which if you don't know basic mean i'm develop a desktop app use chromium &amp; node where the dom is in the same scope as node. i want to offload work to a webwork so that the gui doesn't hang when i send some text off to ivona cloud (use ivona-node) which is a text to speech api. the audio come back in chunk as it generat and get written to an mp3. ivona-nod use fs to write the mp3 to the drive. i got it work in the dom but webwork are need to not hang the ui. so i have two node modul i need to use in the webworker, ivona-nod and fs.the problem is that in a webwork you can't use require. so i tri packag ivona-nod and fs with browserifi (there a packag call browserify-f for this which i used) and replac requir with importscripts(). now i'm get var error in the node modules.note: i don't think the method of native_fs_ will work for write the mp3 to disk in chunk (the stream) as it should be and i'm get error in the ivona packag as well (actual first and foremost) that i don't know how to fix. i'm includ all inform to reproduc this.her an error i'm get in the console: uncaught syntaxerror: unexpect token var vm39 ivonabundle.js:23132step to reproduc in nwjs:npm instal ivona-nodenpm instal browserify-fsnpm instal -g browserifynow i browserifi main.j for ivona-nod and index.j for browserify-fs:browserifi main.j > ivonabundle.jsbrowserifi index.j > fsbundle.jspackage.json...
