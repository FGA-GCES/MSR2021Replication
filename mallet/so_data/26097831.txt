i am attempt to transform a built node-webkit app that i creat into an execut appx win 8.1 metro app.aft creat my appx packag and sign it, and creat my appxmanifest.xml file :i manag to instal it via powershell, but i suspect it doesn't manag to run the entri point for the app. nw app don't have a c# interfac i can use to set a proper entri point.anyon has ani idea on which entri point should be set? the execut launch itself properly, but the appx packag doesn't launch anyth : i see the logo on a black background and then it minim itself to the desktop without ani debug trace.thank you.
