there is lot of question about debug an electron app - this is not one of thosesw are have great difficulti in get our electron app to run local on windows. the app was made by an extern contractor and while they where abl to build on window and ship the packag app to us, we can not get it to work with the checked-in sourc code.i can debug our app in vscode and are abl to step into our main.j file, but what i would realli like to see, is what happen in the but this of cours broke electron.i am instal prerequisit as list in the build instruct but i am hope there is a simpler way to debug electron (not the electron app). i am, so far, onli interest in the .js file and not the nativ (c++) executable(s).also ask in the atom forum: https://discuss.atom.io/t/debugging-browser-window-js/68674?u=dotnetcarpent
