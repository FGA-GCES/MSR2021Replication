i'm current work on design a program in electron. one of the key part to this program will be a search option. similar to other websit that you can search the whole site for page that match your inquiry, i would like to search within the “pages”/“html files” of my program and have it display the search results. prefer a letter at a time display in real time so one can see result as they type, but even an option with search will do. i just need to search within my program pages, not an extern site. i'm have troubl figur out how to get start implement this, sinc php isn't support in electron. i know react can do the letter at a time real time searching, but i'm not sure how to do the search of other page or how to pars them for searching. ani suggestions, guidelines, or framework to get me on the right track would be helpful. thanks!edit: i'm also awar of the webcontents.findinpage() function, but that onli search the current page, not other page in the project path. i am fine defin which page to search manual if i can find a way to actual search them.
