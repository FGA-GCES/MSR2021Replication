how to add plugin like flash and java to a node-webkit app?i have an ifram on my node-webkit app and when i view a page that use flash the page won't load.ani ideas?upd 1accord to the doc to see whether your plugin are loaded, you can use navigator.plugin in develop tool console. your applic can also use navigator.plugins. (for example, it possibl to warn the user about a miss plugin or to use a workaround.) return that flash plugin is available. so what wrong here?upd 2somehow the plugin are now sudden working, just make sure that the client system has the plugin you need, or you can packag it with your app.stil have problem though, like how to tell your app which plugin to use.
