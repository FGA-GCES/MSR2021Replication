im make a electron react app with electron-forg and a react template.i have a function that read a directori and then get a list of all the applic in that folder which will then be display in the render.th call go off fine and return with an array of data which i map.th problem is when the applic initi load or when i call setup from the reload button, it remov the map data, if i save in my code editor or use the test function button which just updat a differ bit of state, the visual reappear, so the data is definit in state, but feel like the state is load a bit faster then the call is returning, it all in a promis and should onli updat state onc it complet so i am not sure whi it go off earli or whi after it has changed, the state it not updat again.
