i went to do a fresh updat server deploy of an applic (via -full.nupkg) the other day and was surpris to see that the file doe not exist in my dist folder. i'v run through and rebuilt on windows, but i'm onli get the .ex and unpack folder versions.i can't recal when i last did a full build with .nupkg deployment, it may have been a few months. i'v tri roll back ani chang that i could think of that are relat (other than electron-build itself, which i can't roll back ani further as it has a critic bug fix in it for us for one of our platforms).mi next thought was a bug in electron-build or that they remov that feature. however, i don't see ani current bug about it, and the document i'v run across (while be a bit vague) at least seem to suggest that it still available.i did see some refer to an "electron-builder-squirrel-windows" modul as a recommend too, but i can't actual find that module. is that what i need/what broke? if so, where can i find it?
