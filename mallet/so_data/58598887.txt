i'm tri to creat an angular 8 applic host in electron. my product structur is as follows:-angular-client--package.json--main.js--src--- app/index.jspackage.json:i have a bunch of data to load on app startup so my app.compon is redirect to a home.compon where i have a resolv set up to load data befor redirecting. i read that in order to get index.html to redirect to anoth component, i need to remov base href="./" from index.html and use hashlocationstrategi in my app.module.ts.so far, this all works. i'm abl to open the index.html file on it own and load the page, run the package.json command "start-electron" work fine, and even debug in vscode work well. the issue, however, is when i run "electron-build-win" (use electron-packager). it open electron but the page is stuck at index.html, instead of index.html/#/hom like the other methods. is there someon i need to do differ in order to get electron-packag to run this? or am i do someth incorrect that i should change?thanks!
