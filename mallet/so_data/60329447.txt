let me show a brief example, it will be easier to tell you what i actual mean.for example, we have some text (it come as one long string). this text usual consist of one question and few answer options. main difficulti here is that we don't know in what format this string come (for exampl there are no one concret pattern of answer options, they could be separ in differ ways: with some point or with number like 1. 2. 3. etc), in other way it would be parseable. are there ani tool or solut for recogn what actual question is and what are the options?id would be to get all chunk of text and recogn them by their type somehow (types: question, affirm proposal, answer options, etc...)i'm a littl stuck with it, it hard to googl and i realli need some advic with it. what i can potenti use or probabl some direct i need to investigate.thank in advance.
