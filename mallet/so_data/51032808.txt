i am work on an nw.js app that use a rich text editor. i would like to implement as-you-typ spell check use the typo.j api[1]. unfortun this api ship with no ui and it is up to the develop to implement one.i will mention that while the chromium built-in spell checker is now avail in nw.js, i would prefer not to use that for reason i won't go into now.th editor is a contentedit div element and current what i have work up for spell check is iter through the text node of the contentedit element use treewalker, pars out word strings, and spell check them. it is convien onc i have identifi the node and the offset of the misspel word to get the geometr posit of the word use range.getboundingclientrect, in order to know where to place decor (eg "squigg underlines" or what have you.)th challeng in this is how to make the ui respons someth of the calib of spell checker which are probabl written in lower lever languages. i have tried:1) creat fix posit div appear as underlin and append them to document.body, and use left/top to posit them correctly.2) split out text node of the misspel word and make them a child of a style span which is insert in their place.1 has the problem of find a natur (and not too kludgy) way of get the decor to follow chang in the posit of the misspel words, such as when insert text befor a misspel word, scrolling, or resizing.2 take care of this problem, howev i would rather not mess with the dom of the editor. for one thing, this can often be pick up when copi and past into anoth app.i am hope there is some other mean of which i am unfamiliar in how to go about this task. ani and all suggest would be appreciated.[1]https://github.com/cfinke/typo.js/
