so i'm look at use node-serialport to communic with a usb devic in electron. i'm relat inexperienc with concurr (especi in javascript), and i'm wonder what the best way to approach thing is. electron document say not to use nativ node modul with webwork becaus most modul are design and implement with onli one thread in mind. my question is, what exact is a nativ node.j module, as appos to non nativ (if such a thing even exists), and what is the best way to go about use them asynchronously? i'v done some read on asynchron comput in javascript/nod but there doesn't seem to be a definit answer as to how i should approach someth like this edit: sorri i should'v ad link to the electron document to begin with electron document
