i'v creat a full node-webkit app that work fine on the mac osx version of node-webkit. everyth works, it load a key extern nodej modul (marked), and the world is good.however, when i tri to run the app on the window version of node-webkit as describ in the wiki, the app crash immedi (in fact, it crash immedi when i tri all the options: drag a folder onto nw.exe, drag an app.nw compress folder, and run both from the command line).th onli thing that get me closer is open nw.ex and then point the node-webkit locat bar to the index file. then i get this error: uncaught node.j error error: cannot find modul marked'i tri comment out the code that requir marked:that return the app to crash immediately. i assum it was becaus of context issu between node.j and the node-webkit browser, but those seem to not be at fault sinc i tri this suggest to make sure it find the correct file for the mark module...w right back to immedi crashing.i'm out of idea becaus the crash don't seem to leav me ani way of know what the error was.
