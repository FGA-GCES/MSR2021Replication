i have creat a leiningen-bas clojurescript webapp. more specifically, i am use the re-fram template: https://github.com/day8/re-frame-template.i wonder if it is possibl to compil this project into an electron-bas desktop app? i notic there are electron templat like https://github.com/gonzih/cljs-electron, but i have no idea how to make the web version coexist with the electron version. is this even possible?update:to make my question more clear:how do you make the electron-bas version and web-bas version share the same code base? is there ani exampl for do so?
