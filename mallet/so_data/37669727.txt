i origin thought that the render process in electron was sandbox in a chrome-lik environment, mean all you can do is mess with the dom. however, i recent learn that you can access the filesystem, run child process and get their output, and import ani other node modul you want. if this is the case, what exact is the distinct between the main process and the render process? is it not a hard separation? what kind of code goe in the main process and what kind of code goe in the render process?if anyon has a good in-depth reading/present on electron app architectur i would love to look at that too; might help clear up some of the confus
