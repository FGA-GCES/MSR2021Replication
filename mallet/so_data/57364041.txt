currently, my software-hardwar integr applic will run a test. the test will not stop run upon the click of the top right x button, even when the applic is closed. a simpl function can be use to disabl the test, howev it is not call befor exit the application.th intent is to disabl this test process just befor the applic closes. i'v tri stop the test by call a function within/und the provid win.on('closed()'){ /// }i'v also use ngondestroy(){ console.log('test') } function, but am have a hard time know how to test it use dev tool debugg becaus the devtool debugg close befor i can see if test is be output. win.on('closed()'){ /// }ngondestroy(){ console.log('test') }i expect set a breakpoint in the dev tool debugg on these function would prevent the close of the applic and allow me to view the values/process of step into the ngondestroy/win.on('closed()') functions. the dev tool close befor i can see if output to the consol is work (thus unabl to verifi that i can add more code to stop my test befor cancel the application).her is an exampl process:open applicationsetup testingrun tests(whil test are running) click on x button (top right corner)cal function to stop testing.exit application. i have everyth i need in the process, i just need to know how to implement it.
