i'm tri to get notif work for an electron app i'v made use angular 5 and electron. so far i have the follow code in my index.html file:a i'v read in place that both of these are requir to make notif work. i am use electron forg to build a squirrel instal as this is also mention to be requir to get notif to work.i have tri use similar notif code in my angular compon but have no luck there either. i have look into node-notifi but am unabl to get that to work, main due to a lack of understand of where it should go in an angular-electron app. at this point all i want is to get some form of desktop notif working, but i can't find ani resourc on how to do that in an angular-electron app.
