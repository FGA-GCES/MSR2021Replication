i am build a newsreader-ish desktop app use node-webkithttps://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkitwhich is basic server and client at the same time. my problem with the facebook api is the following: i want the user of my app to login and present them their current wall-post and the stuff like this. in addition, i have a coupl of news-item from other sources, which should be like-able/share- from this user. the whole app is a single-pag js (more exactly: coffeescript) thing with multipl components, a hard redirect is impossible. everi login-poss shown in the api seem not suit for my type of application. what is the best way to connect to facebook, without have a hard redirect and without an own uri to redirect to?
