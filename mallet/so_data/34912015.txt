i tri to use sequel and sqlite3 with electron and i have problem when use it with webpack.to test the project provid in my descript do will compil the index.j entri point and output a bundle.j file that is use by the index.html for the electron app.when i launch the second example, the index.html that load the bundle.j file compil with webpack i have the error below:ï¿¼to see the errrrr issss,i ad a console.log in the file node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/connection-manager.j line 22 as specifi in this link. (electron and sequel error: the dialect sqlite is not supported) unlik in the link provid which is not about use webpack with electron. the link is my exampl 1 project for me everyth work perfect on the first tri without do anyth more. but i tri everi solut provid for my webpack exampl 2 but noth works.i do not understand why, in the basic exampl when just includ the index.j file direct in the html it work well, but when process by webpack and the includ in the same html it doesn't work ? am i miss someth here ? everyth work if not compil with webpack ? webpack let me write es6 and split all thing into one bundl but if i manual rewrit all file and use onli one file it will work... so from my point of view, here it is more a webpack behave/config problem.
