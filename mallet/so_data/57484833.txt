i am work with leaflet and use html2canva to copi a popup that is creat (for download a copi imag of what the popup is) and i have have problem with the html2canva and give it prioriti over load tiles. the code run well, but whenev you run the function given below and have tile load it get sent to the back of the run stack so it has to wait for the tile to finish rendering. i was wonder if there was ani way to forc either html2canva to the top of the stack so the user doesn't just sit and wait for tile to mayb load.i have updat leaflet to 1.5.1 (which did improv speeds), but still have some problems. html2canva is version 1.0.0-rc.1 (as the most recent version has a problem with border and i am wait for this to be resolv befor updat my version).i am work on this project in a node.j applic (electron). if more detail is need i will do my best to tri and provid those detail (some detail may be consid proprietari inform which cannot be released, but i will still tri and provid an equival exampl if needed).
