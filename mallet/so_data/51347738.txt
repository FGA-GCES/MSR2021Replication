i'm a total noob, first month into javascript, creat a simpl win applic in electron. i need to send inform from index.html/index.j to session.html. i alreadi did it success via ipc, while creat the session.html from the main process/menu. but now, when i creat that new browserwindow (session.html) from the index.js, i get the refer error. i can't seem to find the solut to this, despit it seem to be a veri simpl issue.so, i execut this function to creat a new browserwindow:so the question is simpl - how can i let the main.j see what "addwindow", defin in index.j means?p.s. i tri to defin the "addwin" function in the main.j and set it to global, while execut it on index with "remote.getglobal". the function itself work fine, but the main process still didn't see the "addwindow" be insid the "global.addwin" function.
