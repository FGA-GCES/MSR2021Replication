summary:i am work on an electron app where we load a client web app into an ifram and at one point the code in this ifram call window.top.close() which caus the ui to becom unresponsive. the client is not abl to fix this function at this point so we need to handl it ourselves. what are some options, if there are any, for resolv this issue? i am think i should be abl to loosen some secur on the iframe. mayb with some csp on the parent? i see some framework like nodewebkit have custom v8 handl html attribut to forc ifram to return it own window when tri to access window.top or window.parent, but i feel like there has to be away to just replac wondow.top.clos ifram is alreadi in a webview and cannot use nest webviewsifram content is a differ domainifram cannot be sandbox becaus client code run flash pluginsapp in question is electron 1.3.0what i have tried:replac window.top.close: replac iframe.contentwindow.top.clos from the parent window context work if i load content from the same domain but doe not for the client cross domain code. i do not get ani errors, the ui just lock up
