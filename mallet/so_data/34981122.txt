in an electron project, i'v found that if i put javascript with module.export in the node_modul folder i can access it from both the main process and render process by require() from either place.i this the correct method of access common javascript, or is there a differ best-practice?assum there no particular reason it need to be a node module- like say a global configur object.similarly- asid from a slight messier folder structure, are there ani practic ramif to this method vs. link to it via tag in the render process? (in this case assum everyth in one folder, just to keep it simple)
