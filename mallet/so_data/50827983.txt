the program i have is a c++ program that has qt gui. the issu with qt is that it look realli horrible. we are tri to move away from qt to electron + reactjs.however, our c++ program is "integrated" with the qt gui in the sens our qt gui is in cpp and part of our program, this mean it has direct access to our program apis.w have limit rpc capabl to allow json request so most of the stuff we can migrat to rpc based. however, there are some featur that have to be invok via c++ class member class methods(public). is there a way for react js to call into the c++ program?
