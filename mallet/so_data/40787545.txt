i discov new framework for develop desktop apps. i found electron atom and it look veri well and matured. but i have one qustion:i it possibl to host differ electron app in one big electron app?in our .net applic we have a "global framework" form, which load differ applic in frames. but everi applic can run for itself and can be compil to an exe-file. the goal is to write differ standalon apps, but with the possibl to creat a "suite". for exampl i have app for notes, todo lists, calculating,... and i will give the user the chanc to get "all of them in one app" (the app will display in differ tab for example). is this possible? and if yes, pleas provid some link to a guid or else.
