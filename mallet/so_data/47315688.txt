i'm write an electron app and a few build back tester start notic that two electron.ex process were consum a lot of cpu time all the time. one peg a cpu core and the other use about 85% of a core.i'm certain that this was not alway the case as build sever month ago didn't do this. but i'm at a loss to know how to debug what code chang may have introduc this as the code base has evolv dramat over that time.process.getiocounters() report that sever gigabyt of io is occur everi few minutes. the applic is not deadlock and everyth still work it is just chew through cpu. it happen anytim the app is open even if it is in the background without ani user input. i onli have window 10 x64 system that i'v deploy this to as electron 1.7.9 and also 1.7.5.base on the behavior i'm certain that this io is interprocess communic between the render and main threads, but i'm not manual perform ani ipc. i think this problem is be caus by some modul we'v introduc that improp resid in the render thread.mi question, how doe one debug the the electron render/main thread ipc pipe? can it be hook to know what the content of the gigabyt of traffic are?
