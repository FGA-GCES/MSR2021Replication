i'm current tile mani png imag on sever stack fastlay with konva.js. the pngs contain opacity, and they do not requir drag or hitboxes. the tile are replac often, and this seem to work well for medium-s grid with dimens of around 30x30. onc the tile start grow to around 100x100, or even 60x60, the perform begin to slow when replac individu tiles.i'v start to work on "chunking" tiles, i.e., ad tile into smaller fastlay groups. for example, a singl 100x100 fastlay would be divid into sever 10x10 fastlayers. when a singl tile changes, the idea is that onli that chunk should should re-render, ideal speed up the render time overall.i this is a good design to attempt, or should i tri a differ approach? i'v look over the perform tip in the konva.j documentation, but i haven't seen anyth direct relev to this case.
