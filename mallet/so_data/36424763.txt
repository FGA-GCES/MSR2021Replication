so in my electron app i have a main page with a sidebar (contain some links) and then a webview take up most of the page. i have some page in separ .html file that i would like to be abl to load in to the webview programmatically. with ifram it as easi as set the name attribut of the ifram (say to "content_frame") then have my link as someth like:th first page (landing_page.html) show up fine, but if i tri and use a webview in the same way however, it will open the page in a popup window, and not in this embed webview. i have been use ifram for this up until now but i need to use node stuff from electron (requir from an ifram break everything).
