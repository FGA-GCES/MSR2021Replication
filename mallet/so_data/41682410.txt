i'm use electron 1.4.13, and electron-packag 8.5.0. this is happen on window 7, 8, and 10. i am not use electron-build becaus squirrel did not meet all the requir i need for an instal so i am use wix to creat the window installer.what is happen is that i defin all of the file metadata with electron-packager, but whenev i run the applic and right click the icon in the task bar, it say electron instead of the file name. i'v seen solut that recommend creat a shortcut, but this is not an option, no shortcut can be creat from this application.in the two imag below, the first display the execut properties, and the second display what is seen on the task bar. i also saw recommend of set the app user model id in the nodej code which i'v done immedi after the app is ready:do anyon have ani idea whi i'm still experienc this problem? is there some other file metadata i can chang to get this right?
