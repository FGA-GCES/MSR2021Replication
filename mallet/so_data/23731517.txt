now that tidesdk is effect dead, i'v been look into altern wrapper to run html/css/js applic as stand-alon desktop applications. the three viabl option i have run across so far, are nw.js (former node-webkit), brackets-shell, and electron (former atom-shell).th problem is that there doe not appear to be a suffici complet comparison between the three in term of featur set, compatibility, etc. i'm hope to turn this into a more-or-less canon thread on the (objective) differ between the three, in particular regarding:platform support; oper systems, dependencies, etc.languag featur support, as far as html5, css3 and javascript are concerned. think thing like "doe html5 video work, and if yes, what codec are available?"non-standard extra features, such as tray icons, popup notifications, and os-rend menu bars.extensibility; eg. abil to plug in nativ code, talk to node.js, and so on.architecture; in particular the architectur differ that affect daili usag as a developer.debugging; includ develop tools, compat with common use tool like , etc.... and so on.what are the objective, technic differ that matter when make a choic between them as an applic developer?
