to make a long stori short, i'd like to run my jest test (use cli) with electron instead of node.it relev when use nativ module, becaus you need to build them use electron header while jest run them use plain node. so i must either build my nativ modul for my app (at least in dev mode) or my tests, i can't have both to work. in this thread they propos to use mocha, but i want to use jest, which is far more advanc and interact well with react.not that i don't want to mock the nativ module, sinc i write integr tests.i open an issu about the zmq github repo. one propos solut is "to target your test use electron_run_as_node=tru electron as your node runtime".thi is a veri good solution, sinc use electron will both make the test environ closer to the execut environ and solv my specif issu with nativ modules.i'd like to appli that, but i do no seem to be abl to setup the jest cli to use electron instead of node, and i have no idea where to start. mayb i should run jest programmat without the cli ? but i might lose the nice test filter featur of the cli.ha anyon solv this already?
