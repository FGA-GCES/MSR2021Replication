â€‹i am creat an electron app and all my part are broken out into separ class (separ files). i would like to be abl to have one class talk to anoth use someth similar to ipcrender.send and ipcmain.on howev i want to communic between two piec of code insid the electron renderer. how do i do that? i could do someth silli like mainwindow.webcontents.send, receiv the messag in the main window use ipcrenderer.on, and then immedi send that same messag back use ipcrenderer.send to then receiv it via ipcmain.on but that seem a littl crazy. is there a way to send data around in the electron app, without have to go through main?
