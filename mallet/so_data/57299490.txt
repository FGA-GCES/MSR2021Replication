i would like to use the autoupdat from electron-build to updat my apps. i'm not use github releas becaus i have a privat repo and don't want to includ the gh_token for secur purposes. instead i want to put the binari and the latest.yml/latest-mac.yml file into a googl storag bucket.i know that it is possibl to use a generic provid to check for updates. but currently, i can't get electron-build to even read the latest.yml. i'v pour over the document and other github/stack overflow issu for hour and hour and haven't found anyth to resolv this.her the code i have in my is it possibl at all to read the file from a googl cloud storag bucket rather than s3 or github? also, i'v alreadi tri elimin an extra line or tab from the yml file.
