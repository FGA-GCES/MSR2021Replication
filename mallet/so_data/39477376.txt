solv (kind of): the problem seem to be not due to anyth in the code. as it run fine in ani web browser. the problem was someth to do with the fact that i was run it in an electron shell. as to whi that wasn't work i have no idea.mi question is not so much how to save svg as a png, but instead whi this one librari is not work for a veri specif case. the librari work for convert mani of my chart to png, but there is this one chart that just doesn't seem to succes save the png.this is the segment of the code that appear to be the center of the problem that are occuring.
