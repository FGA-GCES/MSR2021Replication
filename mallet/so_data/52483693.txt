so i'm work on this app in electron, and i notic when i move the app over to my second monitor it seem to lag. curious what might be caus this- i open up the dev console, and sure enough- my anim drop from a veri comfort 100-150 fps, to a consist sub 50 fps. the anim is a height transition, which is poor handl by the browser, but even this doesn't explain the massiv perform drop i see by simpli drag the window over to my second monitor. i'm consid rethink the way i handl the animation, to mimic the current look of it use onli transforms, but it would be nice to know what caus the stutter and lag, sinc the lag doesn't appear to be specif to my height transition. after dig around for a bit in search of an answer, i'm no closer to anyth that might be call a solution. i'm not post ani code with this becaus none of the anim are handl with js. it just plain and simpl css- noth crazi about it.to me this seem like it more of an under issu with electron itself, or perhap someth strang the os does.
