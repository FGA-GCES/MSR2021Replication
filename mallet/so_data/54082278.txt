i have an applic written in elm that play pandora music that is display in electron. most of the time when a song end it move on to the next song as usual, but occasion if the window isn't focus and is behind anoth one (gener when i'm use onli a singl monitor) my progress bar will keep move but the audio will not play until i focus the window. doe anyon have ani idea what may be caus this? most of the time it continu play the song as normal, but occasion it doesn't begin the song until i refocus the window. (the progress bar keep count though, so the code that is caus it to play should be working.)
