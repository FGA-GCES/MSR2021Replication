i have develop a desktop applic use electron framework. i have creat a custom protocol(eg: myapp://) to open url with that custom protocol in my desktop application.i need implement the concept of deep link use in mobil applic to detect if the url is from a specif domain to open in the application.likewis if user have a link (eg: myapp.com) to my web app if he click it must prompt the user to open in my desktop applic rather that open it in browser with https protocol. how can i do it? that is if i have a link as myapp://myapp.com the browser prompt me to open it in my application.but if the link is myapp.com the browser open it with https protocol in the browser itself.in case of android applic we can use intent filter to detect the url and prompt the user to open it in the respect application.likewis is it possibl to do detect url from specif domain and open it in the desktop applic if the user had alreadi instal the desktop applic els open it in browser?
