i'm tri to convert a web applic into an electron app. i have multipl functions, in differ file that i'v import into my main.j use a transpiler.however, whenev i tri do that in my electron app, i run into an issu with a modul i'm use to move away from use php to access my database. instead i'm use the mysql modul on npm.i want to save this function in it own file, and then requir it in main.js. when i tri to transpil it with babel, i get an error about net.connect not work (or someth along those lines). as i understand it, this is becaus of how node works. i'm happi to work around this, but i'm hope there a way to save this function in anoth file, and import it without have to use babel.
