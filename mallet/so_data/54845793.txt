i'm relat new to node and electron so i could be way off on this.essenti what i'm tri to do is creat a spa that has a main navig and the user can click on the link which will load local html file that contain a script tag. current i have a main page that use fs to grab the html file and load it into a div success but none of the js in that retriev file works. i'm do it this way becaus i need to interact with the ui and add dynam element this is what i have for code:mainwindow.htmlthank in advance.edit: if someon has a better way or a “best practice” way, i'd love to hear it.
