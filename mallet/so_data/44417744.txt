i have a fair heavi applic where i chang multipl overlay 4k imag with vuej in electron. i'm take a screenshot use electron immedi after the page is re-rendered. i can make this work with a timeout of 1000ms, howev this is not veri reliabl as i can imagin that slower devic need more time to render the page. i have tri nexttick, but this doesn't seem to fire when the render has been completed, onli after the data has been updated. is there a way to tell when the page is done redraw the chang images, use vue, electron, domev or otherwise?
