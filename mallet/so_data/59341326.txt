i have ad multipl rule to my firestor database. when i test the app in develop mode, everyth work as it should but for some reason when i build and run the app for product all my request are deni with "miss or insuffici permissions." i cannot allow anyon to read, and the documents. the rule are vital and i am not sure that they are the problem anyway. i have use the firestor simul to test calls, as well as the emulator. i am build with the command: basic the top level of the databas is the user ids, and a user can access collect within their top-level collection.
