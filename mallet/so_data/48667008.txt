i'm tri to creat a tool for edit file contain a object that is relat to my compani busi logic. i'm use electron to do so.i'v creat a javascript class which repres the object, handl it internals, and provid buis function on it:i'v just found out that send an object through ipcmain.sendsync use json.stringifi to pass the annotation, mean it loos the getters/funct on it.i'm fair new to web/electron development; what is the proper way of handl this? previous i had handler in main for deal with most of the function that the render process needed, but main start to becom veri bloated, so i'm tri to refactor it somewhat.
