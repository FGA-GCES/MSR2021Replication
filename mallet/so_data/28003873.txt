what i'm tri to do is this: allow user to edit the css properti of the node-webkit app and save/appli them dynam on the next load/runtime. i'm not talk about separ pre-defin themes, but direct edit of the colour to allow signif custom theme possibilities.if this was php which is what i'm use to, i would store the user theme colour in a databas and build the css document per-us and feed it to the html at load time. however, i don't think i can process/build css or other file on the node-webkit "server". i plan to use the web sql databas to store properti locally, i'm just stuck with the reload aspect.what is the best way to go about do this? thank in advance, and i hope i'm make sens with what i'm asking.
