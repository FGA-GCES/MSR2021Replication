i have an electron app and when i start multipl instanc of it, they both share the same localstorage. is it possibl that multipl instanc could have their own separ localstorag "domains" (not sure if that the right word)?what drive how a particular electron app know which localstorag domain to use? i thought perhap it was driven by the file path of the entri point, but i'v run separ instanc from separ folder and even with distinct name entri points, and they both still share the same localstorage.i'm relat new to electron, so forgiv me if there a realli obvious answer here, but if not path, then how do two instanc of an electron app run from differ path know that they are inde two instanc of the same app?
