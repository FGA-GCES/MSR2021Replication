the basic setup of the project i'm work on (windows) is an electron app which communic with r via r serve. now everyth is work fine except one thing that been drive me crazi lately. the problem is that when i use node from cmd (etc. node startr.js) and execut an r script with a command like this:everyth goe fine. but, when i tri to execut the veri same line in the main.j (entrypoint) file for my electron app, i get the error that the r librari (i.e. rserve) can't be found from within r.i have check for possibl caus for this and i have found out that r librari path differ (.libpaths()) when r is call from cmd node and from electron. namely, r lib are instal in mydocu folder, and r call from cmd node seem to see them properly. on the other hand, the same exec from electron make r see onli the default librari path (in program file where r is installed), so it fail to find libraries. i know that this must be environ issu (like it run from an environ differ from the current user), but i'm pretti uncertain what to try. i thought that pass process.env to {env: } option for child_process.exec but to no avail.
