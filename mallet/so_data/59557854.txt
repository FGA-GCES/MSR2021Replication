hope someon can point me in the right direct here. my electron app need to perform an api call everi 10 minut or so. i current do this use a setinterv loop in the render process that fire everi 10 minutes.it general work fine, for a few hour befor it seem to just stop firing. i have sever process that clear and restart the setinterv to tri and counteract the problem, but noth seem to work. the app open new browser window and display content, which mean the main window may not be in focus all the time, which i suspect may have someth to do with it.i have tri ad but i'm not sure if it will fix this issue.
