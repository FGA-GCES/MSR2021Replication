i have a project in which i use node-webkit. node-webkit allow npm packag to be use for develop desktop applications. i make use of grunt to build my application. my folder structur look like this at the moment:th npm depend for the applic itself are kept within the app folder, but the dev depend for build the project are not relat to the applic sourc code, so i keep them in node_modul (1) insid the root folder. i also know that in a package.json file one can express depend and dev dependencies, exact for this reason. i would rather have one package.json file in the root express all dependencies, includ dev dependencies, but i would rather have a separ of those depend on folder level.two question arise:i this a good way to organ my npm dependencies? if yes, awesome? if no, which i expect:what is a better way to organ my dependencies? is it possibl to specifi that dev depend go into folder a, and regular depend go into folder b? if so, how do i do this?in case anyon is wondering, this is the project i am talk about:https://github.com/michahell/pinbored-webkit[upd folder structur to includ app.j for clarity]
