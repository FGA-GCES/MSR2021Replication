i'm build an electron app for distribut through the mac app store. i'm have troubl figur out what code sign work on what version of mac osx becaus sometim my build crash on launch and sometim they are fine.i got the app to notar correct and submit it to apple. they reject it becaus it was crash on launch in mac osx 10.4.6 and 10.14.3 (i have no idea if they tri other mac versions).sinc i couldn't reproduc the issue, in my local build i figur out how to sign a develop build use develop id vs. the 3rd parti mac develop identity.sign in this way i was abl to reproduc and fix the crash. (i need to addnow if i give them an unsign version it launch just fine.i this what i should expect? i can't seem to find ani document from appl about what sort of code-sign work in what version of mac osx outsid of the new notar requir for catalina.i'm tri to figur out if i need to make two test build for qa, depend on what os they are test on, and also what happen when we submit to apple? do they remov the sign for older os versions?i'd like to find answer befor we tri and submit again, sinc i hate to reli on appl to make sure our app doesn't crash on older versions.at this point i'v confirm that when sign for mojav and abov my app crash in ani os lower. i also did find this https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2206/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/dts40007919-ch1-tntag20so it clear that code-sign was enabl in older mac osx version (i think i final found someth that impli that it start in 10.5). so now the question is how do i figur out whi someth that has valid code sign in some versions, crash in others.
