i have an electron app deploy on window 10 system with customers. my app has 3 process run in the background. however, off and on, the process seem to get kill (i am assum by the os). the app is instal under the user directory.i have check into window event loggers, and i do find log for my app. some of the log seem to be about offic 16 click-to-run licens component. product: offic 16 click-to-run licens component. the file >c:\windows\system32\msvcp140.dl is be use by the follow process: >name: ngage , id 14360.i am wonder if window would kill my process if it is tri to upgrad offic 16 or some such. ani thought on this would be much appreciated.regards,arun
