i'm look for a way to build a multi column listview or treeview that work similar to the osx file explorer, except for data instead of files/folders. i need to: have column header (similar to the "name", "date modified", etc below)th first column to be expandable/collaps (as the folder are)sever addit column for data field (ideal the user could pick which are shown and/or chang the order)i saw that electron has dialogs, but as far as i can tell, these are meant specif for file/folders, and not general enough for a data display use case. i also found a few treeview librari such as js-treeview, but as far as i can tell, this is similar to onli have the first column ("name") in the case of osx, i can onli enter text field and onli have one column.do there exist a packag that is flexibl to have the similar function to the osx finder window, but can be appli to a dataset without reinvent the wheel?
