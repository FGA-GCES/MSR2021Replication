i'm make a game with dart and i'm packag it with node-webkit and node-webkit.dart (a dart wrapper for node-webkit modules).mi goal is to have the node-webkit app game appear as a standalon nativ app. to achiev this i'v strip the navig bar and some other things. all my asset are local, the game never has to connect to the internet.i have a few anchor link within my html (lead to my site for example). when i click them current my node-webkit window open the link within itself. besid this never be my plan, there no way to return to the game sinc i took the navig bar away.so my question: is it possibl to make a handler that open anchor link extern (in the user browser of choice)? bear in mind that anchor link may be ad dynamically.i know about but i can't think of a way to make everi anchor link call it.thanks!
