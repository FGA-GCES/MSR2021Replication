i have a flat data file in the form of xml, but there isn't a real window viewer for the file, currently. i decid to creat a simpl applic with node-webkit, just for basic view - the data file won't need to be written to by the application.mi problem is, i don't know the proper way to read a larg file. the data file is a backup of phone sms and mms's, and the mms entri contain base64 imag string where applic - so, the file get pretti big, with larg amount of imag (generallly, around 250mb). i didn't create/format the origin data in the file, so i can't modifi it structure.so, the question is - assum i alreadi have a way to pars the xml into javascript objects, should i, a) pars the entir file when the applic is first run, store an array of object in memori for the durat of the applic lifetime, or b) read through the entir file each time i want to extract a convers (all of the messag with a specif outgo or incom number), and onli store that data in memory, or c) employ some alternate, more efficient, solut that i don't know about yet.
