i'm go to write two applications. first will be web applic in .net core 2.0 and the second will be desktop applic written in electronj (it should be cross platform).i need one system login. i read about oauth2 but i'm not sure if it is good for web applications.i can write my own server authent in .net core in web api but after that user and password will be send from electron through internet each time when i will be need check if user is authenticated.so the better way is to do oauth2 and one window to login that will be ad to web applic in .net core and in to electron. and then i will be check with token if user is authenticated.i it a good solution?
