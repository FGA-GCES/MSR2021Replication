i'm tri to rescal a bunch of pixi.j textur in a separ process, so render ui thread stay responsive. pixi.j is unrel to the question, but i want to provid a bit more context of what i'm doing.unfortunately, i can't make it work. at first i tri to spawn/fork a subprocess, but turn out i can share onli json-encod data between parent and a fork process. bummer.so, i decid to open a hidden browser window and repack them there.essentially, i do this in my render process: internally).mi question is, what is the way to exchang such data between electron windows, or, maybe, there anoth way to solv my problem? i will appreci ani help!
