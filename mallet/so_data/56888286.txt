i am current experi with build a littl app for help my local roleplay group. amongst the tool they want was a scriptabl random so that they could build dice roll tables. unfortunately, i'v hit a bit of a brick wall with regard to need to recurs call a function with an observ in it.i'v had a look through a few differ question on here and reddit cover how to get result from observ or wait for it to resolv but all the solut i'v tri either are invalid code in this context or the parent call doesn't wait for the child to resolve. this includ use map, switchmap and async/await. i'm left wonder if i'm wrong to be use an observ for the file load on this.her the full context in case the short exampl miss somehting: https://github.com/acaeris/draconika/blob/rolltable/src/app/providers/table.service.tsin short:^ this will success return a generat name, and inde the intern roll will also result in a name but it appli too late for the output and so the compon receiv the result befor it finished.what i'm current get is: "the heirloom is a helmet that onc belong to [name.format]" instead of "the heirloom is a helmet that onc belong to ladi amberlin dawnstrider"
