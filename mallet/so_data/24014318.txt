i am tri to design an applic that run on node-webkit. i have this crazi idea for the background, but i have no idea how i should approach implement this with css.this is the app how it look right now:i would like to give all dark green/blu background a see through effect (there are two, the darker for the top and the slight lighter for the toolbar). like this: (mock up, background is mayb a littl too blurred)i do not aim for a solut that has real see-through window (like aero and io 7/os x 10.10). a fake effect with a predefined, static background imag is fine (which doe not have to move when the window posit change).th implement has to be memori and perform efficient.i want to specifi the type of background (dark or light) by set the class of each element (like the tabs, toolbars, etc) to bg-dark and bg-light'.th approach i would take is this:creat two images, one for the darker background and one for the lighter background. (1920x1080px each, becaus my app must handl full screen nicely)g each element a background class bg-dark or bg-light'. this class defin a css background image.with javascript, for each element in a certain class, calcul a valu for background-position.th issu that i see with this approach is that for each element, webkit/blink has to load the entir background imag to memory. is this true? is there a better, more sane way to do this? it doesn't have to be cross-brows friendly, as i onli need it for a node-webkit app (which use one of the latest blink engines).edit:not that css opac doe not do the trick. i want the background to be kind of blurred, so simpl transpar is not sufficient. also, if the select tab was actual transluc (opac &lt; 1), the dark topbar whould show through (which is not what i want).
