i'm tri to build a desktop app use github electron framework, which separ a "main" io.j process from a "render" js process (browserwindow). i think of the "main"/"renderer" process as analog to a server and client (let me know if this is mistaken).i'm confus about how to appli the flux pattern in this situation. some interact with the ui don't requir send data to the main process (i.e. the todo-list exampl )1) doe that mean the dispatch object should resid with the render process?2) suppos the main process receiv an incom event/act from the filesystem. to updat the dispatcher, would the main process have to implement an actioncr to creat an action, then send the action over ipc/rpc to the dispatch on the renderer/cli process? 3) if (2) is true, doe that mean that action creator and store are also implement on the main/serv side?it feel strang to have the "first responder"/"delegate" within the context of a render process.
