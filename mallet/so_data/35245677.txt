i think the titl should be quit self-explanatory. i am develop a node js app use atom electron. what i would need is a way to deploy my applic in a cross-platform way (mac os x, window and linux), while make it capabl of automat updat itself, without have to ask for administr privileges.her is what i would like to happen:th applic get instal by my users, possibl via an easy-to-us installer.i keep develop my app, ad new features, and so on.at some point, i releas a new version of my code, i pack it somehow and upload it somewhere.al the client that are current online, or whenev a client get back online, they download the new version, instal it, and restart automatically, without have to ask for administr privileges.a far as i know, there are app that are capabl of do such a thing. for example, googl chrome automat instal updat without have to continu ask for administr privileg or, even worse, make it user download new instal all the time.i there an eleg and cross platform way to do such a thing? what would be the best solut for my problem?if this is matter in ani way, let me add that my project is complet open source, so i don't care about protect my code in ani way from be read.
