i have begun develop on a "click-to-call" application. the idea of such an applic is that when you select a phonenumber, you can hit a shortcut from anywher in the os (like ctrl + q for example) and the applic will start call this number.right now, we'r attempt to do this in electron, but after a few day of search for possibl solutions, i'v not found ani way to actual do this.i'v found that not mani system support this, regardless of which languag you use and that such behavior is often "hacked" into the applic by just copi the select to the clipboard and use it from there.that hacki solut is also accept to me, however, that too is not someth i'v been abl to do in electron. i don't have ani exampl code becaus anyth i have tri so far doesn't even remot work.thi isn't just a question for a possibl solution, but rather also one that want to ask whether this is actual possibl in the first place?an altern we'v explor is build a browser extension, but here too we'r run into the exact same problem.
