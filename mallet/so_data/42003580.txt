we'r implement an api, where a larg file is to be upload local to the main server.everyth work fine until we tri upload larg file (>= 4gb); those fail immedi befor even get to the route, which lead us to believ the problem is in the client.so, is there a better way of do this?w came up with a few differ solut for this, including:1. serv the video file static from the client side and ask the server to download them2. use ftp/scp or other protocolsbut would realli prefer to just use angular and not get into set up a node server insid of the electron application.update: this error occur on one of our comput but not the other one. the onli notic differ i have notic is that one computer, the one on which is doesn't work, run ubuntu on a newer kernel (~4.4.0) while the other run kernel ~3.19
