i'd love to start work with electron.net but the thing that keep me from do so is the way you have to start and debug your app. on the github page it say you alway have to run "dotnet electron start" in the consol (https://github.com/electronnet/electron.net#start-the-application) just to start the app and if you want to debug it you have to manual attach the process to visual studio debugg (https://github.com/electronnet/electron.net#debug ). is there a way where i can run and debug the app just like ani other asp.net app?
