i'm current tri to find out if a file exist befor i run fs.appendfile() so that i can determin if i need to insert some text at the begin of the document, or if i need to insert a line break.i'v written a function that when i debug it outsid of the electron (this is for an electron app) process fs.existssync return true or fals as expected. however, when i run this in the app, it onli return false, regardless of if it actual doe exist or not.i assum this has someth to do with run insid the context of electron vs run in just a node environment, but i can't figur out how to work around this, so ani help would be appreciated.
