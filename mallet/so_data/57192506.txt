i'm new to electron and made a simpl gui wrapper for a cli execut written in c++.this question is realli two-fold but they tie together, the first be what the proper way to bundl an execut file in my applic with electron-packager? my first instinct was to put the execut in the sourc directori and refer it view file path and although this work for run the applic with npm start the execut file isn't get bundl when i use electron-packag and i get an error.secondly, this execut has been compil for windows, mac, and linux and i'd like to have electron-packag automat includ the correct execut for the target platform somehow.
