my current app (wpf in visual studio) weigh 2mb.and now i want to re-creat this app with node and javascript.why? primari reason is - i want to learn some javascript (yes, this is my way to learn and pleas dont give me advic how to learn js). secondari reason - i want to use full power of css3, while wpf app support onli css2. the problem is weight. ani exampl app build with electron or nwjs weigh about 115mb!!!i can understand that desktop app requir node and browser to work, but 115mb?!so my question is - is there ani way to creat lightweight desktop app with electron/nwj (or similar alternative)?i can accept final weight about 50-60mb.
