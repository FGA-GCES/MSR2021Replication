i am tri to make a cross platform desktop app base on python.i'v been look for python gui framework such as pyqt, wxpython, tkinter, and kivy. however, none of them could provid a good look and feel for desktop gui except for pyqt, but pyqt is quit expans for commerci use, and i do not want to open my sources. in addit to that, make python gui instal seem pretti hard that i fail to make instal program so mani times. so i am now look for someth els which is electron.i'v found that electron nodej can run python app use python-shell. also, electron is be use pretti well and has mani famous products, so i thought it can be a good choice.mi concern are, is it a good way of develop a cross platform desktop app in this way? though i am familiar with html, css and some js, i am not familiar with nodejs. but sinc this is kind of a work around, i am worri this could make a lot of overhead or creat bad user experience.mi python app contain quit a lot of mathmat tasks. not super heavy, but still kinda heavi use mani regressions. also use sqlite for intern database.of course, the best solut would probabl be use nodej instead of run python in nodejs, but concern the time to develop everyth again in nodejs, i thought this could be more practical. if this approach slow the program significantly, perhap i have to find anoth way.so in summary,i it a good idea to make a cross platform commerci app with qualiti use electron and python?do it affect the app perform significantly?if it is a bad idea, is there ani altern or recommendation?
