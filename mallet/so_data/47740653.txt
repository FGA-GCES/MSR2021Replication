i'm tri to build and share an applic base on node.j and the electron technology, but i want that precompil packag (.ex or .msi, for example) instal the mongodb server software.for ubuntu packag i just have to add the mongodb server to the list of depend of my softwar (in package.json configs), and then the packag manag (apt) will instal that for the client.for window otherwis i saw that some (in fact, most of them) game on steam instal directx or other depend when the game is be installed, but i can't figur out how to do this or how to configur it in the electron configs.so the question is: can i "put" the mongodb server instal program insid the precompil packag of my window application?
