what i am tri to achieve:i'd like to set up an electron project with a proper headless end-to-end test configuration.issu encounteredspectronj seem to be the solut to achiev so. howev there is no configur to prevent the window from open on each test. read some of the thread on the repositori + the document of electron in regard to test mention xvfb. i'v tri to get my head around this but understand so far that this cannot be instal on windows? and that there is no alternative.th list on the page includ other option such as appvoy or cicleci but these again are new and i am bare abl to find a guid around these not to mention, i am not realli like that i have to do all these step (link to github/bitbucket account, etc).i'v also tri to go through demo applic from the electronj list page, but not all of them do have tests, and when they do, they are sometim written in what seem to be a differ program language, or specif aim for angular or react, while on my end i am aim to use vuejs.can anyon point me to a clean exampl of an offlin end to end headless test of an electron app on windows?
