i am build an electron desktop app, and one of the first thing i want to tackl is user creation to interact with the db. the idea is they log in and then they are abl to see their own user inform within the app. to my understanding, i can make this happen in pouchdb and that will ultim sync with a remot couchdb server.i am stuck on user creation (i haven't even begun to tackl user session yet). i have creat an form with electron that take an email, username, and a password. i plan to use pouchdb to store inform local and eventu sync with a couchdb server. i haven't written ani js yet to handl the form submission. when they click "sign up", i want that user to be created. i get confus becaus there is a _user databas in couchdb that i understand store user sensit inform (like a password). my question: when a user submit the aforement form, do i creat a db in pouchdb call _users? and eventu when i sync it with couchdb will it know automat what inform to store in users?
