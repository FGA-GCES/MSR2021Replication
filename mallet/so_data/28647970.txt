we have a c++ window desktop applic that doe factori product inspect use vision.th applic acquir imag from i.e. gige cameras, use nativ driver and softwar libraries, and run third parti nativ c++ algorithm to perform inspections. we inspect up to 1000 part per minut with sever cameras.actu we have an old style mfc gui, that show imag (even live images) and the result of the sever inspect threads. we are build a new wpf rich gui, but we have doubt about the futur of wpf and the use of a mix .net applic (and not to mention when you have crash in the xaml stack you end up with an indecipher call stack). we had the idea to build a html5 nativ applic with node-webkit. we don't need a multi os application, but we see the opportun to share some portion of the gui to be use with differ devices. first of all: is this a good idea and is this technolog suit for these kind of applications? if so, we see two options: ad our inspect thread direct in nw.ex (recompil it), and write nativ nodej extens to get data for the html gui.us nw.ex and write nativ nodej extens both forinspect thread and to get data for the html gui.which one would be better?
