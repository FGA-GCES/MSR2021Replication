our electron app need some configur file and usual download them from our server. in case the client is offline, we don't want him to see ani error messages. we are use electron download manag to get the files.thi is how we request the file is thrown, when not connect to the internet.i tri implement the offici event detect from electron but as they state: such as in case where the comput is run a virtual softwar that has virtual ethernet adapt that are alway “connected.” therefore, if you realli want to determin the internet access status of electron, you should develop addit mean for checking.then i went on tri just to ping the server like in this thread but this doesn't work at all for me, it possibl that it doesn't work anymore.
