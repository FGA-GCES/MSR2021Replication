i have an issu when do sign-in from node-webkit app. in the node-webkit application, i open a page on my domain with the follow code:for some reason the callback never fire when run on node-webkit. while tri to debug it i saw someth strange. when i run this from node-webkit, this code will open the googl sign-in screen. when the node-webkit develop consol is open for the googl page, the callback fire successfully. when i load the same page on chrome, the callback fire and i can see the alert, so i don't think the issu is with the code. befor run this code i programmat clean the node-webkit cach so each time the user is requir to enter his credentials.
