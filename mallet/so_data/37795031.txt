i am tri to draw some vector graphic and i found two ways:(i have to mention that i use electron width nodej and therefor the languag is javascript and instead of opengl there is webgl.)triangul the shape and draw it with webgl. i think this is a fast method. but my concern is when you are move singl points, the shape has to retriangulated. and i don't know how fast this can be done.calcual on a per pixel basi with inside/outsid equat on the cpu. but after everi resiz or move the chang pixel has to be recalculated.can somebodi give me ani hint or some experi someon alreadi has made?also how are illustrator, inkscape, etc. render their graphics?thank you
