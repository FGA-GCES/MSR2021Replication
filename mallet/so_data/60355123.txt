i have an electron app in earli beta and we just got a report that it is not save correct to a "document directori that is use folder redirect to a network location". the user is in a large, it-manag comput environment.i work on upath.tounix(path) just convert all `` to / and consolid duplicates, without perform ani normalization.could this be strip out a critic part of the path of a network drive? perhap i should also/instead be using: upath.normalizesafe(path) exact like path.normalize(path), but it keep the first meaning ./. note that the unix / is return everywhere, so window \ is alway convert to unix /.sorri this question is so long but it seem such an odd issu and i don't have an easi mean to debug it. if you have read this far, do you see ani obvious caus for the issue? i saw this question (fileutils.copyfile() not creat file when destin is a network path (on windows) mayb it is related? i am just baffl by all the window slash and escap slashes. . .
