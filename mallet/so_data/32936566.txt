i am use c3.js and electron (atom shell) to make a desktop applic for data visualization. i am have troubl to feed my data into c3. i have a dataarray that contain all the coordinates: dataaray = [ [x1,y1] , [x2,y2] , [x3,y3],...].i use the follow code to break it into an xdata array and a ydata array: however, it doe plot the graph. i was use plot before, and i use to run the exact same code to prepar the data for plotly, and it work just fine. what is the problem here? also, is there a way to ask c3 to ignor error in the data? for example, if there is a null at one of the points, is there a way for c3 to plot the graph anyways?
