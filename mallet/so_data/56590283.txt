i have been design in html to creat an applic that has a gui. i have creat a few script for this - particular one that use the browser window speech synthesi utterance.suddenly, however, the scope of the project has chang and i need to do away with the gui, but keep the tts script run as a background process. i'm still quit new to programming, so i tri open the script with node.js, but it didn't work like that. the utter is program to read a certain xml file. so essentially, all i want to do is to do away with the html browser aspect, and keep the javascript. is this possible? doe anyon have ani suggest on how i could approach this? i'v tri open the script sole in node.jsi'v look into element.j but it doesn't "seem" to be what i am after.actu result - open a web browser and begin talk (there a html file)expect result i want - no web browser, just talk when the file is open (maybe?)
