i'd like to know how to protect a commerci app built with electron. i'm not talk about the sourc code. at least for my specif scenario, i believ the minifi bundl generat by webpack is secur enough (except for the secur part). i'm talk about prevent non-pay user to actual access the application.her what i thought of:in the website, the user can generat an activ code. the activ code is simpli the base64 of the user e-mail address plus a digit signature. the app contain the signatur public key so it can verifi the activ code. this seem secur enough for me except that someon can hack the bundl to start return true everi time. i can't think of a way to bypass this.so, is there a better way to protect a commerci app built with electron?if i don't find a better way, i'm probabl go with what i describ and live with the risk.
