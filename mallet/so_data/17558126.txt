i'm creat an app use node-webkit, so there a lot of javascript. i have written a node.j function that will take a screen shot and save it to the disk, however, it save it to the project root dir and i would like to prompt the user to choos a save location, but i cannot find a way to creat a save file dialog. current code:screen_shot.js:th wait function is just to give the popup i'm use time to close befor the screenshot is taken.i have been read the node-webkit file dialog doc but it is either not what i'm look for or i cannot make it work properly.
