i am tri out a simpl hello world electron app in linux. i want to packag it and instal it on window as well to test if it run fine there. when i did npm install', it creat a node_modul folder of ~112 mb. i don't have anyth yet that even make use of these modules, and the sampl start fine if i delet this folder too. the package.json file has electron-prebuilt as the onli item in devdepend so i assum the node_modul folder was for that.so my doubt is should this folder be includ in the final packag if i want it to run on windows?i check the document here but it just has the 3 file and no depend so i was not sure of what to do in case where you explicit have some.
