i want to use mysql for an electron app in product and thus, if the client machin doesn't has mysql alreadi instal on it, then the app will not be abl to function. so, is there ani way to execut a auto-instal mysql script that instal mysql on the client machine, even if it not alreadi installed. sinc the app has to be cross-platform, so i am look for a standard or minimum effort procedur (to speed up the process) to achiev the above, dure first-time-app-startup on windows7+, ubuntu 14+ and macos.i found the follow way to auto-install:window : linklinux &amp; macos: creat a bash script that run befor first-time-startup of the app. (although, it will check whether mysql instanc is alreadi present on the machin or not)look for a better option than the abov mention ones.
