i am write an electron app that need to use the raw-socket module.a i figur out the raw-socket modul can run onli in administrator, so i use sudo-prompt to run from within my app a nodej script that will do the logic that use raw-socket.th problem is that when i do npm instal the raw-socket modul get place in node_modules, then when i use electron rebuild to make my modul compat with the nodej version use by electron, it also make the raw-socket modul compat with electron nodejs. then when i tri to run my node script (which doe the logic that use raw-socket) via it tell me that raw-socket is compil for a wrong node_modul version(becuas it was rebuild to work with electron nodej and not with my system nodejs).can someon help me to organ my project so that wont happen?
