edit 1: thank to ppotaczek it seem that the problem come from the chromium engin as the problem doe not manifest on firefox. some contexti'm current work on a monitor applic for energi system (involv heavi duti batteri and inverters). the applic communic via can bus with a voltag sensor on the system. the goal is to display in realtim the voltag valu of multipl cell of batteri (it can vari from 13 to a 100).we are use a python back-end hook to an electron app that run react (sinc it a new app 90% of the code use react hooks). the problemw are current face an issu caus by the rerend of each of the chart everi seconds.it caus the entir applic to suffer from micro freez exact at the time of the rerender.w think the re-rend is the culprit becaus disabl it make the app smooth even though we keep all the communic layer run gif video : https://i.imgur.com/zrvrwhq.mp4th coderight now the data are collect in the python backend and format as such : thing we alreadi tri :collect the data in the graph compon parent onc and distribut it via prop to avoid collect the same data multipl time (a bit wors than now becaus the contain has to re render everi seconds)us highchart class compon instead of hook to use the addpoint method as they showcas (even wors results)collect the data insid the widget compon (current situat see gif) to avoid the contain rerender.
