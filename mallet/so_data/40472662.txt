i am go to write a desktop-app that should be abl to store it mass-data persist and locally.i want to write that app with electron. later, i want to port the app to mobile. i am experi here with nativescript and the angular-advanced-se which tri to make it possibl to reus code on differ platforms.a database-tool i want to use pouchdb becaus i didn't want to have the user setup/instal an addit tool for have a databas for the desktop-app which run seperately.also, i like to use pouchdb, becaus it has this nice sync featur with couchdb, which i can possibl use later in the project when the need for sync with an onlin databas will arise.now my questionshow can i use pouchdb to store data local (it can be a mass of data that exceed the localstorag limit) even when the app has been stop by the user. i need to load that data in the app, when the user start the desktop-app the next time. i read about pouchdb use leveldb, but i can't find the data persisted.i it possibl in electron to have a databas run insid the electron-app, so that i do not need to instal for exampl mongodb on the user pc/mobil app too?it would be nice to have a solut that will work on mobil (ios/android) too, so that i have the offlin capabl too there without use a differ approach for the data-storagear there ani other solut (combin of) databas tool to satisfi my needs: a. same offlin storag capabl for mass data, that exceed localstorag space restrict for desktop (electron)/mobil (android/ios) and web and b. good sync-funct to the online-pend databas like (pouchdb/couchdb or minimongo/mongodb) c. in-app databas should have the same queri api like the server-databas (minimongo/mongodb)thx in advanc for your tipps.
