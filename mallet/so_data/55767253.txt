i'm work on a project where i use electron-vu and to make the app look better i use bootstrap-vue. after a lot of debugging, i have found that chang a data property(in the parent component) that is link to bootstrap compon props. it will give me error messag tell me not to mutat prop values, and that they are read-only. as it seem for me, the code work and executes, but will give me a lot of error in the console. when i say it seem to work, what i mean is that both console.log and visual on bootstrap compon it seem to chang the variabl correctly.aft write a lot of test case i have found out that chang a data properti doe not give an error. but when chang a data properti that is link to a bootstrap compon prop it will.a test case that show where these error messag show up is in the code below:i have tri to use googl for similar problem and look at the doc for both electron-vu and bootstrap-vue, and can't find anyth that help me. is there anyon that have run into the same problem or have a solut on how to get rid of those errors?
