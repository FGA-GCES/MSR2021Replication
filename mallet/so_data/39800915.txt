all my test run and pass successfully. but i keep get either 0% coverage, or coverag of my karma-test-shim.j that launch the test and their sourc file via systemjs. i have tri use karma-coverag as a preprocessor in various way as well, sometim it pre-process the spec.t files, sometim the ts files, sometim the app directory, sometim the js file or spec.j files. i use the electron browser to load a requir shim in the karma-test-shim.j file, as this is an app with plenti of system-level oper use node modul like fs, path, etc. i use systemj for the app and test (no webpack!). this test setup, minus electron browser and the requir shim, is similar to my setup: https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/karma.conf.jsher is my karma.conf.j file.
