i'm make an electron applic along with create-react-app for the frontend. the applic requir an activ mqtt connection. so, somewher in my electron code, i have to includ the credenti for access the mqtt broker. these credenti are not someth that an end user should be awar of, so i decid to hard code it. after packag the applic with electron builder, for ani platform, there alway a .asar file in some resourc folder after applic instal that can easili be extract with the help of npm librari like asar. after extraction, all of my electron sourc code is out in the open and so are the credentials. is there ani work around for this?? is nw.js the onli other way to avoid this happen or is there a way to use some c/c++ addon for this??also, are there ani electron react altern boilerpl that somehow overcom this?cod obfusc is a somewhat ineffect solut for this as the password is still there, it just hard to find. this is my first electron applic so haven't realli found much els on how to overcom this.
