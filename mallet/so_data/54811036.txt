this is the first time i'm build someth with electron.now, i read everyth there is in the faq section of this modul (node-pcsclite) and the "can i use this librari in my electron app?" section.i tri everyth from the electron doc (use nativ node modules). the onli thing i didn't tri is "manual build for a custom build of electron" - sinc i'm not run a custom electron build.th i tried:differ version of almost everything.tri do everyth on osx and linux.old node and npm versions.differ electron headers.check that the cpu target architectur are matched.tri packag the app with electron-build and run it on osx.tri re-configur the electron-build with option such as builddependenciesfromsourc and npmrebuild set to true.remov node_modules, remov cach and tri re-instal everyth a few times.tri manual copi the "pcsclite.node" from node_modules/@pokusew/pcsclite/build/release" into the build folder of the project and repackag it again - still get the same error.no success. i keep get the follow uncaught except whenev i run the app (whether with "electron ." (npm start) or as a fulli packag app with electron-builder).th onli thing i find a bit suspici is the folder structur for this module, sinc it has two parent folder (node_modules/@pokusew/pcsclite/...), and that mayb some path are misconfigured, but i don't know where to look or how to debug. i did howev see at some stackoverflow comment that peopl are manual configur some modul path in some cases, but i'm not sure how should i approach this, or even if i should be do that.
