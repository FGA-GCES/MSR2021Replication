i am current tri to add these svg knob icon i made into an electron app use flexbox. the catch is that they need to stay posit in the center of the rectangl icon no matter the browser size, like so. so ideally, as the browser dimens change, they stay confin to that rectangl and maintain their proport within it. right now, as the icon scale from chang the browser window dimensions, the icon posit over and under-shoot relat to the box, illustr here. currently, i have set the browser window of the app so that it maintain a constant aspect ratio. here is my relev html: here is my svg, the code for it was too long to includ in the post.an import detail which i can includ here though is the svg viewbox, which is: "0 0 72 66.5" in the abov code, i made the width for the imag ~13% becaus that was the ratio of the width of the svg to the width of the background (in percent form).
