i'v stumbl upon a weird issu with what i assum to be a webpack or babel compil problem. this is kind of hard to explain, so bear with me.a littl backgroundw are run a mono-repo hybrid that we'r call a flat repo where it share a singl package.json and use relat path for the imports. the reason we'r not use lerna or yarn workspac is that flow doe not play nice with a mono-repo without have to transpil the directori and that was a deal breaker at this time. but i digress, this repo is use react/electron and react-nat to build out our apps. folder structur in a differ terminal, that it will sometim "reset" itself and success compile.mi webpack config is a generic version of the eject cra config.i don't believ it to be a config issu though becaus sometim it will compil accur and work. i am at a loss and the googl doesn't seem to have much to offer on the subject. tri to build the project throw the same error as well.thank for anyon who read this, i appreci ani help you can offer.hav a great day!
