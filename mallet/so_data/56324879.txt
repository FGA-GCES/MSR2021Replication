i need to pre-author a url to use microphone. it an intern system access via electron (v4.1.3).pre-author is requir as user use it in some sort of linux thin client. that is, each day the system bootstrap from an imag and then profiles,etc are created. therefor user would have to click yes on the access prompt everi singl day, and if hit no just caus headach to provid them step to fix as the system requir mic/audio.i'v check googl chrome, and appar it write the permiss on file. so, to be honest i don't even know where electron is store the permission. i delet the aforement folder, but it doesn't ask permiss anymore.i there a way, like write to a prefer file, i could pre-author this? if yes, would write that to the imag file.
