i am play around with electron and webstorm as part of a project prepar and i am struggl with differ problems. therefor i want to start simpl by creat veri basic stuff and work my way up.so i have a veri simpl project setup in webstorm and my first electron app is running. but webstorm keep say that it cannot resolv function names.electron and electron-prebuilt are ad to the to the javascript librari from the communitie-stub repositories. but these seem outdated, as there is no github-electron anymor and all other electron entri are ambiguous.so my question is: how to setup webstorm for plain js es6 correctly, begin by elimin the "unresolved" messages?
