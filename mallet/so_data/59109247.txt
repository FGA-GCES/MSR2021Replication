i tri to run cypress end-to-end test in openshift. local it works, but in openshift occur an error after start the test via the cypress run command.error messag in openshiftif i tri to run the test dure the docker imag build (run npm run cypress-run) everyth work fine. the cypress-run npm script is just a shortcut for "cypress run".th error occur if i tri to run the test after the contain start (entrypoint ["/usr/local/bin/npm", "run", "cypress-run"]).it occur in the electron part of the cypress implementation. i think the problem is, the docker imag build is perform by the root user. the contain will be start by a differ user. it seem that electron is set the appdata path dure the cypress instal to a directori of the root user. later the user who is start the contain and is run the test is not abl to access this appdata folder.i'm not veri familiar with electron. mayb anybodi know how to forc electron to creat this appdata folder somewher else?
