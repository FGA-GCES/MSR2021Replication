i am tri to have an svg fit the browser window in an electron window. i have set the width and height of the window to 600 and 840, respectively. right now, unless i doubl click the grey bar at the top of the window to full-siz it, there is a white bar that exist at the bottom of the screen. the peculiar part about this problem is that the white bar kind of skip when it appears, as i decreas the dimens of the window. i'v set the aspect ratio and initi browser size with electron, evidenc by the relev part of my main.j code.
