i'm work on a vscode extens and it need to execut a extern program to do differ task. if the extern program take no arguments: ui pop. with cmd line arguments: cmd line mode. i'v build this applic use electron and it work well in debug and when launch it with electron on the cmd line. it was packag to a .ex on window and work equal well in cmd line or direct doubl click it.th get bad when i tri to execut it from my vscode extens with child_process.execfile. i just put the exe path, and the process stay in the task monitor (no ui). i put some cmd line arguments: node reply: bad option. i'v tri to run it within a tools.bat file, so that i call the bat instead. doe not work either. i'v tri with fork, spawn, exec. same behavior.launch code:note: the same code with a normal execut build with visual studio in c# for example, work well if i launch it with exec. we just want to use electron with js so that the team feel right at home.
