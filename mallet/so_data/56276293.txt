in my html code i have href link to files, which are be downloaded. i would like to creat a javascript file, that check the last modifi date and chang the style of the anchor tag to make the name of the link turn orange, until it is click for the first time. is this possibl in javascript?i am use electron and am wonder if there is a way to implement this.thi is an exampl of the link in one of the html files:when i tri to call it, i get "notifc is not defined"i thought of creat a function that check for the last modifi date, which is call when you click the anchor tag. this function should then call the donotify() function, when the date has changed.i know this is a lot. should i mayb break this down into fewer questions?
