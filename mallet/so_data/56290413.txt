i'm use this code, but when it get the sourc the height and width are set by the constraint in the code block below, but i want to get the actual size of the video.th result captur imag is 990x770 of cours but this result in an imag with a black border around it. the real video sourc is 995x744 but it get this new size with black border as a result of the given constraints. if i don't set ani constraint then an error is thrown say the width is 0 so some kind of width need to be set.even manual input the video sourc size of 995x744 into the constraint doe not work sinc it seem to need an area bigger than the sourc to captur it. not sure whi it can't be captur exact as it is? mayb there someth els i'm do wrong that could remedi this?how can i get the size of the video as i captur it so the constraint can be set to the actual size of the video? so the captur imag is exact the same size as the sourc video with no black border etc.
