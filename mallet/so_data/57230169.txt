i'm collabor on a vscode extens that use a nativ modul (@serialport) which need to be includ / pre-compil for each platform/electron-vers combination.if we onli includ the current versions, it frequent break when vscode updat the electron version. some platform can nativli re-compil , other can onli after a (very) lengthi instal of rather-complex toolchain that imo should not be requir for end-users.so we want to includ the relev prebuilds,and for that we need to look ahead in time ...i'm look for a reliabl method to determin the electron version use by vscode- current version- and the futur (insider) version- in addit it may be good to includ a prior version to allow for backward compat i have found that master/.yarnrc has the current ( or next imminent) version today it is 4.2.7vscode current releas use 4.2.5 prior version can be read from the version historymaster/.yarnrc but what about the futur / insid version ?what is a good method/loc to determin that programmat ?, i.e. which branch has the insid version ?probabl answer base on below hint and some more probe : next version is in master copi the bind file for all abi-arch-platform combin to a folder, and inclid that in the vscode extens packag at load time , determin the abi version of the run instanc of vscode/electron, and dynam load the modul from the abi/platform folderaltern / addit approach:- as a last ditch effort the code could tri a just-in-tim download of the pre-build bind file for the current platform, but this might run into permissions/malwar scanner problem as that is essenti download download execut code from an extern github repro.curr script code to download the bindings:https://github.com/josverl/pymakr-vsc/blob/fix/serialmultiplatform/scripts/mp-download.ps1
