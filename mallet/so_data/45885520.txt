what i'm tri to achiev is "real" app-lik behaviour in a sens that when i close the app on maco (hit x, so the app is still in dock) and afterward open the app from dock again, the webpag content should be there immediately. as i'm tri to build a contain for a web-app, the behaviour i'm get is that everi time i open the app, the web page is load again caus friction in the ux.i'v tri some dirti workarounds, like call .hide() on main window from the render process befor unload the window: preload script load the cach content into the webview and onc the page loads, overwrit the webview content, but it also seem veri hackish.i know slack behav exact how i want my app to behave, but i'm struggl to find how they achiev that instant-load (or perhap not ever closing, except when quit is select from the dock or cmd+q is hit).
