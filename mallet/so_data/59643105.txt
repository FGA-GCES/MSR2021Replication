as demo here can&#39;t succeed in make transpar window in electron (javascript), i manag to run the hello world applic on a debian buster with background transparency.however, when i tri this demo on a raspberri pi 4 (raspbian desktop), it doesn't work out of the box. i read here https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/315/how-to-create-a-transparent-window-with-electron-framework that it could be caus by some driver bugs.can someon help me understand the issu with more depth ?the need in my project is to display an hd video in the background and a few button in the foreground. chromium-brows doe not benefit as much from the hardwar acceler as omxplay doe (and drop frames), so i'm tri not to emb the video in the browser. instead, i plan to have the smooth omxplay run in the background and display an electron app with transparency.
