i'm current creat an electron application, where the main page is a list of action a usb-connect devic can do (arduino) and the command is sent via com port (uart?). in the same application, i'v a menu option that open a new window where i can choos 4 com port for 4 modules. how do i preserv the com connect after the select com port window is closed? i suppos an altern question could be- what is the right way to do this?mi rudimentari code is currently: properties, and i don't even know if it'll keep the serial port open.
