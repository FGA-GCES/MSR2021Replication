we have a nativ c++ add-on run in an electron render process provid uint8array bitmap data to javascript where it is paint into a canva via textimage2d in a webgl context or putimagedata in a 2d context. the uint8array is alloc in the nativ addon and pass via a callback to js. it is not dealloc immedi after the callback ends, and is kept in a memori pool that hold the last 10 frame sent to be avail for async painting.if the array is pass as is to putimagedata or teximage2d, the render complet freezes. if it is copi into a new typedarray beforehand, there is no problem, but we would like to avoid the extra copi operation, henc the memori pool.i have a feel the freez is relat to the way chromium handl gl command via it command buffer.i'v tri the follow chromimum command line arg in an attempt to isol the issue, with no luck - render process is frozen when the array is not copi beforehand): doe nothingani idea what is happening?
