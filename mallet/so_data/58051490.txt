i am creat a nativ app with angular and electron, and right now i am tri to get the user to chose a path for creat a folder. i have two separ text boxes, one for the name of the folder and the other for the path (which is bound to the output of an electron dialog). i want to have the valu of the path input be bound to both the name and the path. for example, when the user start type into the name box, the text is append to the valu of the path box, to show the final folder that will be created. how could i do this?i have tri use angular keyup binding, but i can't figur out how to chang the valu of the path input. i have also tri use interpolation, but it onli updat when a new path is chosen through the dialog, and when there is noth in the name field, it show up as undefined.thi is my compon html:i want the box to be live-updating, like the exampl at the bottom of the page in https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngbind, but that seem onli to work in angularjs, and instead of ad to a text element, it doe not show how to add to an input element (the exampl use a span element to interpolate). if anyon know how this can be done, i realli appreci the help. thank you!
