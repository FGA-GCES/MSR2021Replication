i am work on an app use the electron framework(atom shell) and i am new to nodejs. this download a larg file as two(or more) piec (>2gb each) by specifi byte rang in the http get requests. after it is done i want to combin these two files. till now i have been abl to think of a solut such that open up both file and use fs.appendfil to append chunk of second file to first one. it seem to me that this will be a veri slow process and also will block down nodejs. is there ani other effici way. i am also will to spawn a child process and use some other application.
