we are use electron-updat (https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-updater) to auto updat electron window instal (with no user interference). this work (from a generic server).a new requir is to check via an api call, if for this specif machine, for this specif custom an updat is need and to updat to which specif version. on the server side a tabl is kept for each machin with the prefer of which version to updat to (or not update). e.g. if a custom has test version 34, we can then updat all his machin to version 34 while the latest version might be version 40. the machin should never automat updat but onli on demand.it not complet clear to me (from the documentation) how to "jump into" this. i am awar of channel (https://www.electron.build/tutorials/release-using-channels.html) but i can't find the detail on how to set a channel dynamically. in theori we could have hundr of differ custom with hundr of devices. do i need to creat a channel per custom which then would requir to make a differ build for each customer? or could i just creat "one" build and then receiv inform via an api call which would then "configur something" to updat to a specif version. the differ here is that the channel topic talk about beta/alpha but in our case each custom defin themselv what they see as their specif prefer version. prefer i dont want to make a build per customer.so preferably: one build : which then request info via an api to which version to updat versus defin this in package.json and have to distribut a specif version to each specif customer.
