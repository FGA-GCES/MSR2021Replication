i am run an electron app, where in it render process i use html5 localstorage. i'm interest to know where in my file-system is this localstorag actual store (i believ it is in sqlite format).i saw the answer for where is a browser localstorag stored, here:wher the sessionstorag and localstorag stored? i'm ask this becaus i would like to be abl to run 2 instanc of this electron application, so that each applic will have differ set in which i save in localstorage. specif i'm most interest in window 10, but an answer wrap all os will be great.
