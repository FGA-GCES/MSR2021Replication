i wrote a mini photo galleri app in electron. the client want it to be abl to drag and drop photo from insid the galleri into other documents. generally, this works: an imag drag into a rich text editor will then contain that image.however, the client specif need the photo to be droppabl into adob indesign. for some reason, photo drag into indesign from insid the electron app appear as text object with a link to that file. indesign will onli accept photo drop from window explorer. i tri mess around with the properties, etc, but noth seem to work.i there an obvious way to transfer a file as an actual binari file (or howev explor doe it) in electron?
