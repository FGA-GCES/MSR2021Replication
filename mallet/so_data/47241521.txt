i am tri to packag an electron app (that use wasm) with electron-forge.at the moment (while i fight packaging!) it littl more than a hello-world, but it compil a simpl rust lib to wasm, then i copi the .js and .wasm file into ./src/ and packag as an electron app.run it use "electron-forg start" work perfectly, but when i packag it with "electon-forg make" (to a dmg on mac os in this case) and then instal and run it, it seem to be tri to load the wrong .wasm file (or it been modified...) as i get these errors:ther is onli one .wasm file bundled, and i have check the .js that it has the refer to the correct file.if i go into the .app packag in /applic and navig to the packag sourc file all is correct, and the same as my sourc folders.check the magic number of the .wasm file also seem fine..so, i don't know what file it tri to load as .wasm and whi the magic number is not correct.ani ideas?
