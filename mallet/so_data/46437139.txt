i am develop a vue+vuex base app run on electron.i hold a directori path as part of the state, signifi the current work directori for the user. in the app, i have a compon in which i want to display all the file in the work directory. however, those chang over time (the app / user can delet them, creat new files, renam file etc...).th way i origin structur it was to have a getter, which given the current work directori from the state, would fetch the file list. however, as the work directori didn't change, the getter (which onli depend on it) wasn't call again.i don't want to gold the file list in the state, as i don't want to have to updat it + the actual file on the machin for everi action taken.i lather it right now by have a "refresh" action that delet and reset the work directori in the state, trigger a call to the getter. however, have to call it whenev i suspect someth happen to a file is a littl tedious.what is the recommend solut here?
