i have recent been work on an electron applic which requir the storag of data in a javascript file which get decrypt when the user log in and displayed, and encrypt when the user log out. however, while log in, the user has the option to add data to the javascript file. unfortun though, when this process is complete, the new data is not displayed, despit use the exact same code in the initi display as in the reload. i am confid that this is due to the javascript file need to be reload (file chang are not regist by electron). i have tri the ani solut would be welcom as i have so far had no luck. thank you in advance!
