i have a game that i'v built with javascript and i'm use electron 5.06 to packag it. both the mac and window build work without ani issues. i need it to run as an arcad machin for an exhibit, so i want to build a linux machin to run it off of. i instal mint 19.1 and built the linux release, but i can't figur out how to run it. when i click on what should be the executable, it says: "the file "game" has no known program associ with it. use the open with dialog to pick a program to open it with."i'v been search but i can't seem to find a way to run it. has anyon come across this before?thank
