i have been look for a solut when a relat large(10-20mb) file is drag and drop to the folder which need to be push to it git branch from an electron app just after the custom quit button of the app is clicked.currently, i am not use ani node modul for git actions. i am do it via exec(git commands) but it seem i need to wait for a respons in order to inform the user that the file are push and it is okay to close the app.mi question is, are there ani methods, best practic where a respons is return when a larg file is push is successfulthank
