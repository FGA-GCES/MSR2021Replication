i have an electron app that can open differ windows.on app launch the app open a set of window(s) (that load the same html and js files) but with param to chang each window display infos.exampl :obvious pass param in file:// path doesn't work.i can't find a clear solut in electron document or elsewher on internet to condit my render window to a param.i can probabl use ipc communic after window readi but it seem a littl bit too complic until i just want pass a variabl to my child view.p.s. : to be total honest my applic is built with react/redux and the param i want to pass to view is the redux store key to listen for this view.
