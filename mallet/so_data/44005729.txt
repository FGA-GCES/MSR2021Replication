i'm just start to play with electron today. i need to be abl to get the avail window size, and to updat it on the window resize. it seem that this isn't as simpl as it is in a convent js app. what the recommend way for keep track of the window size?at the moment, i have my main process and a singl renderer, with no plan to have more than 1 renderer/window open at a time. i have tri to use the following, but it seem complet wrong so i must have misunderstood the docs.edit:i it reason to keep track of the height by watch the bodi of the app? i can set this to 100% width/height and watch it, but it seem a bit of a hack.thankstom
