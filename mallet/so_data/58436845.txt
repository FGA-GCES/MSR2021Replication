i am current build a nativ applic use mapbox gl js that has a veri import satellit map component. the comput this app will be host on will like not have an extern internet connect so it is import to be abl to host the tile intern or on the same computer. i was wonder if this is possibl with mapbox gl js? prefer with the usag of .mbtile (like you can download here https://openmaptiles.com/downloads/tileset/satellite/). if so what is the procedure? i can't find anyth in the mapboxgl js doc that indic if/how this is possible. the nativ add is be built use electron if that helps.
