i'v been tri to debug an issu with our electron app for a while now but it becom quit the conundrum.issue: intermittently, when use the quit shortcut (cmd+q), the app ui success goe away but it stay in the menu bar(mac)/notif try(win) and display the beachbal of death on hover.and i have to go to activ monitor to actual forc close itapp not respondingthi onli happen with the packag product app and not in dev mode. on look through the log it seem all the quit event are proper hit., then almost alway we hit this weird hung up state, but when the menubar is visibl and we initi a quitandinstall, it work fine.
