i'm tri to do an asynchron read in usb with fork() from the child_process modul in electron. that is to say, when i click a div (id="read") a messag is sent from the render process to the main process, which then in respons call fork() and read in data from usb asynchronously. to handl usb communic i'm use the node-serialport library. index.htmlif i run this code as an event handler in respons to a "read" messag from the render process, everyth run normal and i read correct respons from usb. i'v confirm this is not a problem with my usb device, and that in simpl use case usbcomm.read() behav as expected. i'm wonder now if node-serialport for whatev reason won't work with code run insid of fork().
