i am use the the appauth-j librari to do help with do and auth code flow + pkce in my electron + angular (7) project base off this seed. after build the built packag and tri to launch the app all my redirect back to local host keep failing.when run the app in develop mode use (npm start) the auth flow work fine becaus electron use ng serv and the whole auth flow work correctly. after i packag the electron app and then tri to launch it and login then it seem like the redirect to localhost are failing...i think this is due to the fact that when the app is run by open index.html from the built dist folder... so there is noth handl the call to local host.aft search around everyon seem to say you should be abl to redirect back to localhost... and i have seen in done in app that use the same method of open index.html direct from the build dir... so i am not sure whi it doesn't work for me. but also all these app alway redirect to just the root of localhost... i want to be abl to redirect back to someth like localhost/login.p.s2 solut i was think i can do are:us a separ window to launch the request to the auth server + webcont to catch the redirect and pull the scope out as explain here instead of launch the app straight from index.html... start up some kind of node server will redirect all call (/*) back to index.html... the problem with this is... i am not sure how to pass the rout like /login down to index.html... i heard u can includ a hash after the _dir/index.html path but i am not to familiar with it.thank everyone.
