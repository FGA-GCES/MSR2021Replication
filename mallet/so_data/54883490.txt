i'v an app built with electron and vuej / vue-router.in my electron index.j i have this function, for hide the window onc time i'v open the app.mi problem is that if i hide my window with mainwindow.hide() the splash-pag make a push of rout but it will never creat a compon (login-view or logged-view).instead if i remov mainwindow.hide() the app redict toward my compon correctly.y i can hide window onc time i am in the new compon after redirect, it isn't the behavior that i would have.so is there a way for redirect if mainwindow is hidden?
