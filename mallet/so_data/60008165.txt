i have an electron app. it spawn a few node process in the background, like so:so, in order to get all this to work, i'v copi my node binari into the extraresourc folder, along with the child process script. i'v also had to copi a bunch of node_modul into extraresources.mi subprocess, the node script, requir full disk access permissions. i'v enabl full disk access in "secur &amp; privacy" for both terminal.app and my product build (re-en with each new build). thank to debugtron, i'v determin that the subprocess are not, in fact, inherit full disk access....everyth work great in develop mode... it the packag app where i'm have trouble.
