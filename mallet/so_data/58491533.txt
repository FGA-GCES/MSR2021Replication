i'm tri to get python reactivex stream (use rxpi library) to be sent to a javascript on web ui component, but i can't seem to find a way to do so. also, i might need to get the data stream come into the javascript into a rxjs observ of sort for further processing. could you pleas help me understand how to achiev this? i'm still get a grip on reactivex so mayb there are some fundament concept i'm missing, but i'm struggl to find anyth similar to this around the net. this issu has come up as i'm work on a desktop app that take data from a csv or a zeromq endpoint, and stream it to a ui where the data will be plot dynam (updat the plot as new data come in). i'm use electron to build my app, use python as my backend code. python is a must as i will be extend the app with some tensorflow models.follow fyear realli well made exampl as an initi structure, i have written some sampl code to play with but i can't seem to get it to work.i manag to get from the ui button all the way to the python scripts, but i get stuck in the return of the pricesapi.get_stream(...) method. index.htmlth front end is straight forward.i have been look into use websockets, but fail in understand how to implement it. i did find some exampl use tornado server, howev i am tri to keep it as pure as possibl and, also, it feel odd that have alreadi a client/serv structur from electron, i'm not abl to use that directly. also i'm tri to maintain the entir system a push structur as the data requir don't allow for a pull type of pattern, with regular poll etc. thank you veri much in advanc for ani time you can dedic to this, and pleas let me know if you requir ani further detail or explanations.
