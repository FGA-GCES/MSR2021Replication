i am use electron for my web app but i want to creat onlin document for the app rather than embed the document within the app. the issu i have to deal with is the app version number. as i releas minor or major upgrad to the app, the document need to reflect those changes. however, the person who is use app version 2.0 would see document that contain all the 1.0 stuff plus anyth new that has been ad in 2.0.there are a number of way of deal with this. i could just have a link in the app to a url where each url is specif to a version. the downsid to this is that i have to copi all the document from the 1.0 page to the 2.0 page and maintain that could be a hassle.anoth approach is to just use one url but pass the version number in a queri string and then hide/show those part of the document that are relev to their version.if you'v had to deal with this issue, what approach have you taken?
