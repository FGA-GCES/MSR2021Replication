i have tri mani solut but none worked. we have creat a electron base app which contain socket-io.norm it work fine but in the product build after it sit idl for some hours, or like after a sleep and when we open it next morning, we have multipl listen initi or someth like that (we are not sure sinc this doesn't happen in dev build so we don't have logs, also we haven't yet integr ani crash analyt so we are guessing) sinc what happen is, we have that listen tie up to our local push notif of pc. just like in slack or teams.so after idl the user get multipl notifications, count is not certain and sometim it 2-4-7 , sometim it littl more like 10-15 sometim it hell out of the bar, like 80-90 of them and this hang the laptop.insid code we have like: which basic listens.
