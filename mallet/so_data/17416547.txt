i am a bit green on linux in general. i have a beaglebon that has angstrom installed. i'd like to strip away as much as i can to get boot time down to a minimum. all i want it to do, is boot up - straight to an app.j or node-webkit (i believ there are pretti much the same?) application, display a twitter bootstrap html/css gui.a node.j applic will be tie to this; and will be serv the veri same page up via express.js.so what doe app.js/node-webkit need to display itself? how doe it work? i am from a microsoft background, so to display anything, in my mind, is you load the os which has all the api for display, and then you load the graphic application. doe the linux kernel itself have this built in? or do you need other packages'? would love a detail answer to this; i'v been run around the internet for days.
