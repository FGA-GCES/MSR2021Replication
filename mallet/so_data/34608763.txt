i am tri to figur this out, but i realli need some insight.i have express.j applic that run either on sqlite3 or on sqlserver. depend if it is run on desktop then it use sqlite (nw.js) and when run on web it use sql server.i am tri to use the same code base, as much as possible. so far i have a method that provid connect to the applicaiton. i use this sqlserver modul for express.jssqlserv has method query, that accept pure sql statement (crud) and doe whatev it need to do.mi plan is to use the same sql statement for both versions.but it seem that it not the case with sqlite3 (compil for nw.js). it has differ command such as run, all, each...i there a singl (like in sqlserver) command in sqlite that will accept raw statement and work on it, without use run, and all. i mean, someth like:"insert into mytable(myname) valu ('john').if there is, i would simpli add a new method with the same name "query", and both version would work.
