i'm tri to display an imag in my electron app that would indic that the app couldn't load the url. also, the app should keep tri to connect again to the server everi 3 seconds. basically, the behavior i'm look for is like in chrome when you get this screen:so far, i'v manag to get the part where the app persist keep tri to connect, but i can't figur out how to display custom html in case the connect fails. this is what i have so far: again when reconnect to the server, the "custom" html get overwritten by a white screen.
