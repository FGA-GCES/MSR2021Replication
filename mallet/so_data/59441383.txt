i am tri to packag an electron app with electron-builder, the most popular librari for releas electron apps. i am on a mac and i have a develop account. when run the build process with the command electron-build build --mac zip, electron-build will automat search for a develop certif in my mac keychain access, and appli it to the app. when i build the app for mac it seem to build it fine includ sign it. the log in the termin relat to sign is:i get the same error result when i build and tri to execut ani electron app includ the helloworld app on electron get start page so it universal. electron-build has a boilerpl they recommend that use webpacker, which i don't need for my app. if i just download that boilerpl and build an app it doe sign it and it doe work without the error. so that confirm that it not an issu with my develop id. i'd rather not use their boilerpl becaus it add anoth layer of complex and i'm not sure how i would make my already-built app integr with their boilerplate. i just want my app signatur to work on a regular app. am i miss some basic step? what could be caus this issue?
