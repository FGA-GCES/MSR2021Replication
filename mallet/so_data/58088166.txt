i'm tri to build an electron app (mi first) on window 10 (use visual studio code and git bash as tools), and for some reason my app has simpli stop updat base on css changes. in particular, i have a search box which i had been play around with use differ bootstrap form input styling. however, when i decid to take all of that away and just put in a vanilla html form, i still get the fanci bootstrap input. i can success chang the html by ad more text that show up in the app, but as long as i have a text input element, i end up with the fanci style bootstrap input. i tri delet the electron cach for my app, and i then tri delet the entir ~/appdata/roaming/myapp directory, neither of which helped. i then tri creat a new app entir in a new folder, reran "npm instal --save electron", copi in my html and js file (but not ani other files), and tri again... and i still get the bootstrap style form! i have look at solut like the one describ here (electron not use updat css file) but without ani notic difference. i am at a total loss of what to do and can onli imagin that either electron is hide anoth cach somewher or that somehow visual studio code or git bash are hide cach somewher that are screw me over. here are the onli 3 file in my project:package.json:i would great appreci ani insight you guy may have! i am a novic with electron and am hope there is someth simpl that i can do to fix this problem. thanks!
