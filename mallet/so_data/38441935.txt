i'v written an electron applic and implement my own input widget to be use with my applic - optim for mobil touch input.wheth this is a good idea in general or not should be not part of this discussion.mi problem now is that when i instal my applic on a window 10 tablet the os will open the on-screen keyboard whenev i focus an input-field.of cours the on-screen keyboard can be toggl off in window itself - unfortun it doesn't seem to work as expected...if i turn off the keyboard it will not show anymor anywher - window explorer, browser - nowhere. it work as intended.but the electron app still open it even if i stop the correspond window service.so my conclus is that electron itself open the keyboard and ignor whatev the system tell it about it. i didn't find ani document or api to turn this featur off though.do anyon have ani idea how i can achiev my goal?thank you in advance,patrick
