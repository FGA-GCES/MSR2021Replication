i'm use electron for a project of mine. i need to pass an url between windows, which i'm do by use the url the follow way: on said variable, so encod the url is not the problem. i even tri with a base64 encod to pass between the pages, no success.so judg from all this, i reckon that the problem is not the encod itself, but the pass between pages. my (probabl wrong) theori is that the url might get somehow veri slight alter (losing/gain some information, special charact maybe?), which wcjs-player is not prepar to handle, but chromium is (sinc there no problem with the electron window use the result url). i have no idea to fix this, i'v tri all my ideas. did a fair bit of searching, but didn't realli find anyth useful. i can solv it anoth way, but that would involv open and process the same file twice - in both window - which i'm tri to avoid.i'v pretti new to javascript overall, so pleas excus me if i'm miss someth trivial. ani help is appreciated!
