tri to figur out how to run electron in it own process, separ from the caller.i have an electron app that run a small reactj web form. when i go to launch electron, the caller won't return until i close the electron window, therefor forc me to keep this extra call window around.launch steps:when i do this, the command prompt wait indefinitely, until the electron window closes. as such, i have to have two window open, which isn't ideal on a product environ (i'd like the user to click a *.bat file on their desktop, on for just the electron window to pop up; not a cmd.ex window and the electron window).thank you in advance!!!
