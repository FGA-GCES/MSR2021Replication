i have a react/ electron app. i need to get some databas tabl from my main.js, and i need to set the state to this table.for this, i have written the follow listener:it wait for main.j to send a sendtabl event, with the tabl as the argument. then, i set my redux store to that table.thi kind of works. however, i don't know where to put this listener. if i put it in the constructor or render function of my component, i end up with an infinit loop. but i need to set this up once, sinc i do need to listen. where could i put it?
