i have creat a littl electron program for one of my friends, it is a patcher for a privat metin2 server of some sort. the game itself is realli old so it requir a few redistur to be installed. [dxwebsetup0411 / dotnetfx35setup / vcredist_x86 ( i believ it a 2013 version) ]i want to includ them as an option at the end of the instal (or even befor it, doesn't realli matter).i have found a few exampl how to do so but they are all for standalon nsis instal and when i tri to includ that script ( in the build/installer.nsh file ), the build process crashes, presum becaus it not the main build script therefor ad section is prohibit (?).im realli new to nsis script and nsis overall.so far i onli figur out how to put checkbox and label and so on in, with the help of nsdialogs, but as i look at it documentation, it seem that there are no option where i could do this. ani help would be great appreciated.edit :mi script current is almost empty, i onli chang the default directory, but anyway here is that: everyth i know about electron-build nsis main script and this includ script is here : custom script examplensis- electron builder
