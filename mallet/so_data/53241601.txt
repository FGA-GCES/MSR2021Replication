i'm tri to locat the center point of an element relat to the entir screen, and for that i'm use window.screenx and window.screeni to calcul the posit of the window on the screen.i'm see veri weird inconsist with window.screenx and i'm not sure what the caus is.if my window is maximized, it return 0 as expected.howev if my window is not maxim and the window is on the edg of the screen, it return -7. in fullscreen mode both window.screenx and window.screeni return 8.as you can imagin this throw off my center point, and i'm realli at a loss at what is caus this. is this a window specif issue? a bug of some kind? are there other way i can go about grab the center point of an element relat to the screen?thank you for the help.edit: i thought it could be someth to do with the window shadow in window 10. i turn off the shadow but still get the same results.edit2: for anyon that might read this later, this is not exclus to electron. a workaround (but not ideal) could be remov the window frame. i'm open to ani more suggestions.
