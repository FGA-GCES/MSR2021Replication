we have an app which launch electron browser. in the electron browser we load a third parti websit which has a link. when we view this site in the chrome or ie browsers, click on this link it render a pdf in an ifram but for electron browser it show a save file dialogue. we want to display this pdf in the electron browser just the same way it work for chrome and ie. as it is a third parti websit we don't have control over render or load pdf file or we are not get ani event relat with load of this pdf. for this scenario, if there is no way to display pdf in electron then it is ok to block it so the save file dialogu will not show.(thi app is actual in the kiosk so we don't want to save a file if it doesn't render in browser.)thank in advanc for your comments!
