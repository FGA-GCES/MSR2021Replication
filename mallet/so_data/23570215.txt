i'm in the process of creat an app that has tasks, todo's, calendar events, etc. for android. however, i have look for week and have not found a way to notifi user without know java. i use intel xdk for development, and it has push.mobi stuff.th thing is though, i can't have my app reliant on a connect to the internet. the best way to explain my goal is this: googl calendar and other app will give you alert and notif when a certain time comes. i need to be abl to do that, use html5 node-webkit. is there a way? what is the best way i could go about this?
