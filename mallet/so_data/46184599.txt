backgroundi work on an open-sourc github electron app for transcrib video. i want my app to be multiplatform, so i use open-sourc travis-ci.org to build it for both maco and linux (ubuntu), then publish the binari to github releases.what i'd like to have happentravi build for osx and linux concurrently. what actual happenswith my current yaml configuration, travi test and build serially: it make the linux version first, then the mac version onli after the linux build finishes. (i believ it build in that order becaus it the order in which i'v specifi ose in my yaml). here an exampl of that serial build behavior below is my to make the distributable. (bi default, that command will build a binari for the host os.)mi hunch about how to answer my questionmi guess are that one (or more) of these are true:what i want isn't possiblewhat i want is possible; i just have to make a minor tweak.what i want is possible, but my attempt to do it is larg wrong and/or misunderstand the relationship between matrices, jobs, and stages.i'm encount someth electron-specif (although the build for linux seem to go fine)mi apologiesi wish i understood travi better, and i thank you for your patienc and your help.
