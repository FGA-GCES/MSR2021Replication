i'm work on an open sourc electron project which i am build use webpack. one requir for my project is to use the nodegit librari which has to be built as a nativ module.i'v follow what appear to be convent advic when work with nativ modul and electron. that is, i run electron-rebuild, have configur the sourc packag to use and final have configur node-load to catch the import of ani has failed.th general ask here is "how do i get this nativ modul work in my project?".i also have a correspond question over at the repo, although on the off chanc that my issu is unrel to the librari itself, or that there are some battle-worn veteran of nativ modul in electron, i figur so would be a good place to check as well.
