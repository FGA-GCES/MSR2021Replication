i'm consid develop a cross platform electron app. accord to the electron website, electron use chromium, the open-sourc version of googl chrome browser. however, given the privaci concern regard googl and chromium and electron implicit use of googl services, i wonder if use a chromium-bas platform would be a good idea.th eventu app will need to be as secur and privat as possible, as it might be use to process sensit data provid by the user.do electron and/or it chromium compon track user in ani way? do they make ani internet connect by themselves? do they collect and send data to third parties? is it possibl to run electron while offlin (see these reports)? is the electron framework appropri for design privacy-focus apps?
