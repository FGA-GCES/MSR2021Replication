i'm investig the feasibl of creat a music player base on the web audio api (insid an electron container), that can use vst and/or au effect plugins. i'v been searching, but haven't found anyth similar online.i'm not deepli familiar with the architectur of audio plugins, but i think it should be possibl to pipe raw audio data through a plugin and return it back to js through some kind of c binding. befor i go down a long research road, i thought i'd ask if there were ani obvious road-block to pipe web audio through a vst plugin (mayb through node-ffi or someth similar)?
