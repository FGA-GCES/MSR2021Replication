summaryi'm new to electron development, and help to lead a small project at work creat an electron application. after work insid the git repositori for a day or so, the electron window sudden stop appearing. i'v determin that the function callback i give in the print statement for insid the on readi callback is never reached. no error are be emitted.conclusionat this point, my suspicion is that there is someth on my comput that is mess up. the git repositori that this code run insid seem to be caus problem as well. i'v done a lot of googl and i can't find anyon els face this problem. the onli thing i can think from here is to tri scrap our entir git repositori and creat a new one (which may or may not be possible), and take my comput into tech support for a possibl replacement. ani clue on how to move forward would be great appreciated. thank
