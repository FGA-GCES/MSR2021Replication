i am go to build a nw.js (node webkit) app for portabl (mac and windows). as i'd like the app to run on mobil devic (io and android) later, i use ionic framework. as suggest by ionic folks, it better to keep two set of views, one for ionic (mobile) and one for nw.js (desktop). hope i can share code in the control and factory.so, here is what i do:1) creat a ionic skeleton project: folder of ionic? to further extend, i may replac ionic by bootstrap and leav onli angularj code (control and factory) to be share between the mobil and desktop apps.
