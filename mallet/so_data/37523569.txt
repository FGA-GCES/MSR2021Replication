( on linux and window onli )what option do we have ( or the one i know of )1. use some nodej api which alreadi incorpor c/c++ add on ( like winctl, which is use for detect activ window chang in window )question :mi effort in find ani such node api has gone futile. doe anyon know of ani such api or has work with a similar api? 2. use command line ( node child process and exec function )question :is there ani way i can detect activ tab chang through command line or shell script ? ( i have also explor this option but i am still far from what i want to accomplish ) 3. use c/c++ add on in nodejsquest :this is someth which i would tri to avoid as i know it not trivial to creat c/c++ add on for node. but still as a last resort, has anyon use ani c/c++ modul for the similar purpose. if yes, can you pleas point me to the same. 4. write separ browser extens ( for chrome, firefox and ie ) - last resort, sinc we want to have just one app which can instal on user machin rather than multipl extens and softwares.no question hereani help / suggest in this regard are most welcome. thank in advanc
