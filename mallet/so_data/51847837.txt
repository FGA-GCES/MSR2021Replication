i have recent start work on electron and i came across electron-builder; this tool use electron-webpack as the standard boilerplate, so i tri to understand how the last one worked; unfortun i wasn't success in find the right document (i mean, i'v found the offic documentantion, but noth about what i was look for).when you creat a simpl app with electron-webpack there is a src folder; insid this folder there are a main folder and a render folder. i know how electron creat differ process for each renderer, but i don't understand how should i use the render folder... i mean, all of the code in my applciat execut by the render process is insid the tag in my ej files.i alreadi know that i can disabl the use of the render folder but i want to know how it can be effici used, just to learn new things.if you can link me ani guid or tutori i will be veri grateful.apolog for ani grammar error, i'm not mother tongue.thank you for your time!
