i have a node webkit applic that use the mdns modul for publish a bonjour servic from a mac (with mavericks). when i run the server code with c) i tri skip the configur step (just to try) and the build command break with: could not automat locat src directory. this isa temporari chromium featur that will be removed. use--depth as a workaround.but when tri to use --depth (of course) it requir an argument, i couldn't find out what to put there.so... how should i build the mdns modul for use it with node webkit? (either the 0.8.6 version or the 0.10.0, i can adapt).
