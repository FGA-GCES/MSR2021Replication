i'm tri to figur out how to specifi the file detail properti of the main execut file use in a node webkit app. more specifically, when the end user right-click the exe file and choos properties', then under the detail tab, there are field for product name, product version, copyright, etc etc. these are blank by default. how do i specifi the content for these fields?i would have assum that i could specifi this in my app manifest.json file, but the "name", "description", and "version" properti in the manifest file seem to have no effect here.ani ideas? or workarounds?
