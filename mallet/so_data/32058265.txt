we have develop a desktop applic use node webkit and it work fine. my onli doubt is that, do we need to perform minif on the .js file written as part of node js server component. we usual perform minif on the javascript written main for ui view to reduc payload dure load of relat javascript of the html and also to hide code inform in the script so that it hard to modify.so do we need to perform similar kind of concaten and minif process on the node js server side .js file and then share the node webkit execut to the customer. without minif of node js files, the applic work perfect fine. so, go back to my question -- do we need to perform javascript concaten and minif for node js application?
