i am develop an electron applic and i have rather an architectur problem in general.whenev i have someth that need to be done in the main process, i do it direct in the main.j file, i believ this is wrong becaus i will end up with a veri long monolith file. !now i am ad more classes, and some of those class should listen to an event. let me give an example:in my application, i should have a profil instance. this profil should be updat when the user attempt to login from the render process.now my problem is where to creat the instanc of profile, and how to automat listen to load_profil event for example? and do i realli need to creat a profil instanc in main, the onli part that i need to do in main is load and store the profil in desk. all other interact with profil is done in renderer.i am new to node.j and electron so it fundament architectur is a bit confus for me.
