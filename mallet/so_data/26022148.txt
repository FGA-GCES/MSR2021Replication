ive built an angularj applic over the last sever month that util a mysql databas for it data. this data is fetch by angular make call to php and php return json string etc. the issu is onc this applic is run insid node-webkit, none of the php works, so all of the content area are empty. i assum (though the document on this issu is null and so i have no confirmation) this happen becaus node-webkit is a client-sid applic framework and therefor wont run server-sid languag like php. is there a way to expand node webkit to run php and other server side languages? i have done my best to find an answer to this question befor posting, but document for this is nonexistent, and all of the inform i have found about node-webkit talk about instal node on your server and instal npms for mysql and have angular make call to node. this defeat the purpos of the applic entir as it is design so that the exe/deb/rpm/dmg can run and you can set up a databas with ani cloud databas provid and be readi to go. not ideal if you have to buy a vps just to run this one thing.i have to assum this is possibl in some way. i refus to believ that everyon with an nw applic hard code all their data.thank in advanc
