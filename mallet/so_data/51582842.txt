electron tray applic can show balloon use the tray.displayballoon method that take an object with title, content and option icon property.to my knowledge, the balloon interfac doe not includ a click or onclick property. the tray class doe have a balloon-click event that fire when a balloon is click as well as a balloon-clos and balloon-show event. howev the event object pass to the callback function doe not seem to includ a refer to the balloon that dispatch the event. (the balloon that was displayed, click or closed)mi tray applic send balloon notif from differ sources. what happen when you click the balloon (where to navig to or what window to open) kinda depend on what the balloon is saying. i need a refer to the balloon that was clicked, not just that there was a balloon click somewher at some point. i can think of mani way to implement a solut rang from a simpl wrapper function and an activeballoon variabl to an entir balloonmanag class but i don't feel like wast my time if i just overlook this in the electron api documentation. this question was also ask on discuss.atom.io in august 2017source: https://discuss.atom.io/t/tray-balloon-click-how-to-know-which-balloon-is-clicked/46744
