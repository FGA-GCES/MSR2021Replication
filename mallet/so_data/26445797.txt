i'm tri to make a simpl web browser in node-webkit, to polyfil featur that chromium doesn't support yet (time element, etc). i have had success in listen for the iframe.onload event and then append a script tag with the polyfills, but this still mean that featur that i'v polyfil won't be detect by modernizr or other featur detention.i'v tri load the page use the http node module, append a script tag and then turn the page sourc into a data uri for the frame but data uri essenti turn extern page into static html with no scripting, which render mani web page unusable.also, load a page through node http modul is prove extrem slow compar to load through an iframe.so, is there ani other way? ideal i run a script in the ifram befor ani other script are run. yes, i am use nwfaketop and nwdisabl on the iframe.
