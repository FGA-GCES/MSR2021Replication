whi on earth can i not move my main.j file into a sub directori and have electron build from the that sub directory? for instanc my file structure:when i run start electron launch the intro screen("to start your applic run ...") and not the applic i creat at ./src. is there a packag out there that allow for this to happen? is there someth i'm miss in the package.json file? been a while sinc i post to so but this one got me stump / it not clear document on electron site(you'd think it would be in architecture). i do see in the quickstart about file structur but it doesn't say i can't do as i illustr above^ it not realli a big deal i just hate when im forc into a specif file structure.
