i'm creat a desktop applic with electron and angular7, which persist data in a sqlit3 database. to perform crud oper in the angular applic i had to implement a communic between electron render- and main-process. while this works, the problem is though, that i had to add new event listen for everi singl databas oper i want to perform.thi boil down to inflat my main.t file, where i creat the browser window. it just feel veri wrong to write basic write the same code over and over again and more or less onli chang the event name. i follow some tutori for this, sinc i'm quit new to electron and also angular, this tutori in particular (also i didn't use electron-forge): how to creat an electron app use angular and sqlite3...and end up follow this advis to make node sqlite3 modul work:how to use sqlite3 modul with electron?aft implement the basic stuff the createwindow function in my main.t file look like the following:it doesn't look too bad yet, but i also onli ad oper for one tabl so far. if i got the concept right, i understand that i have to add new listen for everi new tabl i want to use in my application. i am look for a way to either add event listen in more dynam way or a differ and better strategi to connect a sqlite3 database. at least a way to move the whole regist event listen to differ files.
