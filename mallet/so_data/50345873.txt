i have creat an instal program for my applic use nwjs. i need to packag the nwjs app into a singl exe. i was go to use window iexpress becasu that would provid exact the function i need, howev i can't use that becaus it doe not support directori insid the archiv and even with the app html file packag into package.nw nwjs still requir the local directori to run and also iexpress has some secur flaws. basic i need someth like this:1: it is a singl portabl execut file which contain some sort of archiv with the nwjs file in it.2: when the exe is run it extract the archiv to a temporari directori and run nwjs. 3: when nwjs exit it delet the temp directory. so far i have not found ani way of do this.
