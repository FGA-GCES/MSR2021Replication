i am work on port a linux desktop app to an emberj on electron applic to allow for a more custom user interface. while most of the control are a good fit for html and css, i need to be abl to draw around a dozen video display insid the electron window, and i'm concern that do this via a pile of rtsp stream would be signific overhead.th video is avail from gstreamer pipelin that i built in python, and normal i would draw on an exist gtk applic use someth like the following: method that can be use to find the window and xid to draw on. electron browserwindow has a function to get the window handle. however, this return an unsign long as an 8 byte node.j buffer.i there a way in python to turn this window handl into a window object to find the xid? is there a way to look up the xid base on the unsign long handle?
