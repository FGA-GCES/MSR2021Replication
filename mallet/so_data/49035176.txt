i'm tri to set up a project use a combin of re-fram and electron and i woud like to instal re-frame-10x so i can easili watch certain part of the app-db. i have use it befor with a regular clojurescript/re-fram project access via googl chrome, but not yet use electron. i'm hopeful, as i believ electron use basic the same code as chrome under the hood.i follow the setup instruct on the re-frame-10x github page and all seem to be ok. howev i'm not abl to call up the 10x window. this is part of my project.clj file, notabl the clojurescript dev builds:thi is just the main function not be found. the project.clj file specifi 2 dev builds, dev-front and dev-main. i had the clojurescript compil option in the wrong section. move them to the correct section get rid of the error but the re-frame-10x window still won't appear when i hit ctrl-h.
