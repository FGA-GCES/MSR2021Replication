i have a softwar user interfac built with node-webkit, which work great for most platforms. however, on redhat linux 6 os chromium is not supported, and node.j requir some hacki method that i shouldn't be allow to autom for other compani nodes. this is becaus rhel6 has lock glibc version to 2.12 and the gtk version to 2.18.basically, i'd realli like to avoid have to build an entir new ui (in a differ languag than html/css/js) just for rhel6 users. is there a desktop runtim such as node-webkit for rhel6 that i could use as a base for the front end of my software?
