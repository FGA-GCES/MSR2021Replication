i want to program a desktop app in javascript (with web technologies) and look for a comparison between electron and chrome apps.everyth i need seem to be possibl with chrome apps, but there a big hype around electron/nw.js. what are the advantag of electron? is it due to the larg amount of node packages?i think the function differ are clear to me.pro and con like: updat 2016-08-20:as eduardo point out, googl announc that they'll discontinu chrome app for all platform except chromeos. so i think the answer to this question is obvious now.for all of you who develop a chrome app and are interest in migrat it to the web here a guid from google: https://developers.chrome.com/apps/migrationor, as googl also mentioned, you migrat it to electron or nw.js.
