i need to put togeth a nice interface/ux that will run fullscreen as the primari shell/ui on purpose-configur hardware.html5/css/j will be the absolut easiest design path; i don't have anyth that requir rock-solid 60fps framer or similar high-perform requirements, so the live-reload natur of html easili make it a winner for rapid development. (plus, i'm use linux, so i know my next (real) altern is qt, perhap with python. that won't be as fast to iter with.)sinc this is go to be an embedded/appli type setup, i don't need the "one-click run" packag natur of electron; indeed, i will far prefer the more tradit approach of a local application-/web server run in the background.so, all i need is a basic headless browser to appear fullscreen for the durat the machin is turn on.that could be chrome, but here the thing. the general internet will be access from the devic in question, but onli my own backend process will use it. i'd prefer the renderer(s) not access the network directly.i understand chrom{e,ium} contact googl for telemetri and metric tracking, as well as to fetch safebrows list and so forth - and that this behavior cannot be turn off, to ensur that some major of web user don't end up with what are (in the context of "the whole internet") arguably-insan secur defaults.but for my use case, this behavior is pointless, becaus i'll onli ever be access 127.0.0.1. there no point for me to wast my bandwidth on this i/o; the effort be made to updat this data in the background is effect wasted.i'm current wonder what render solut to deploy, and weigh up nw.js, qtwebengin and electron (in that order). i particular like the follow from http://wiki.qt.io/qtwebengine: auxiliari servic that talk to googl platform are strip outif i knew nw.js did the same thing, it would be a shoo-in and my choic would be made, but i'm not sure where to look.i it a good idea to make the effort to build a simpl qtwebengin kiosk shell, is nw.js resourc efficient, or is there anoth option i haven't thought of?i'v tri cef in the past; it seem somewhat clunky, or at least the demo shell doe (i'm not up to recompil it). perhap it exact what i'm look for and don't realize?
