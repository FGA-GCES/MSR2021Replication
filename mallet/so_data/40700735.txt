is there a way to scrape a websit in electron. my goal is to be abl to go to a websit and scrape the html tags. i am use a window machin so i launch the app(npm start index.html). my think was to creat a .js file and use requir (url, function(err, resp,html){ }) like you can do in node but this doe not work in electron. this code is not abl to scrape the page and do a callback. i just want the html only. how can i get this done?th code in the app.j file that i do a call back on is.th callback work fine but the code is not executed. there is a lot i don't understand so feel free to direct constructively. the goal is to be abl to scrape ani site with this.
