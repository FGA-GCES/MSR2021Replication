i'm current look int a project with electron. i am look at make myself a littl util app, where, when i do this normally, in such as c# or c++ i creat an ini file which is in the same locat of the execut so i can load it and chang various set without the need to rebuild the app, or have ani complic set screen from within the app itself. i want to do someth similar with electron but i can't see where this is possible. i can find area where you can read local file that are extern to the electron app that are on disk but not file that are bundl with the app. i.e. i can open an ini file when the electron app load (the ini file will alway be present, there won't be a chanc where it won't be, and when it come to be bundl and instal for deployment, the ini file will be with the execut so i can modifi the ini file manual and then reload the electron app which would read the ini file. hope this make sens
