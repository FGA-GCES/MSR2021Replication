i'm have a problem with my angular5 + electronj app. when i run the app in the browser, everyth work fine, but with electronjs, everi time i click an item in the navbar, that should chang the rout of the app, electron just goe into a blank page, display absolut noth in the consol either.from what i'v read, this is a problem with how angular router works. thing i have tri (unsuccesfully):chang my it will take me succes to that route, and will load the component. this is not work for me, becaus i have some services, that need to start at the same time as the compon is loaded, and right now they are start with the app, and are alreadi run when the other compon are loaded.
