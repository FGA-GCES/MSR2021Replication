i am use foreverj within my electron app main like so:i am do this intent over use child_process.fork becaus i want foreverj to monitor the fork and restart them when needed.wel - the abov works, but look at my dock on mac osx, i see that the electron app is duplic for each fork. in product it is the same -- the app icon get duplic n time in the dock for each process.investig further i found the caus but not the solution. the caus is that when you fork a process normal use child_process from within electron, it launch it use the electron helper app.howev when you fork a process use forever.j it use the electron app itself, thus explain the duplicates.how do i forc forev to use the electron helper app when fork and not the electron app itself?
