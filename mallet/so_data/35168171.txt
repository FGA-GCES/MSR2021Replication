this is probabl a simpl question but i can't for the life of me find the answer online. i'm use nw.js and you specifi the main html file in the packag file. however, how can i navig in the same main window to a differ html page? the window object doesn't seem to have ani way to do this. it has an open() function but that open a new window which isn't what i want.
