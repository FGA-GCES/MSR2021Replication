so i am work on a small feature. basically, it add a border to the desktop. so far, i got the design and everyth down, but the two window (two monitors) layer over everyth else. so i can't click anyth on my comput becaus the border (which have a transpar background) are over everything.example:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43588940/46045103-819c4480-c0d1-11e8-92ce-6c36b4ec6cc9.pnga you can see, the border work but i can't click anyth on my desktop becaus it is block it.so my question is, how can i link these border to the desktop? sort of like a desktop gadget. i just want it to stay in the background, so it isnt block all the comput functions.also, i can't click through the border becaus it is a transpar window and electron doesnt support click through transpar window (feelsbadman). so i'm kinda screw i just want border on my desktop with this lolmi code:
