i want to creat a window desktop applic with electron.j that will load and use .net assembl (for example, call it "display.dll"). this assembl depend on extern dll ("line1c.dll") that ship with some hardware. seem like line1c is a com-object, but, unfortunately, i haven't ani docs.i can instanti class line1c.line45 from line1c.dl in my winform applic simpl by ad "use line1c;", refer to a dll-file in "references" in visual studio and it work fine.i can call class in .net assembl from my electron applic with electron-edge, but when i tri to call display.dl class method that creat line1c.line45 instance, i get an exception:"system.runtime.interopservices.comexcept (0x80040154): retriev the com class factori for compon with clsid {9aa62c52-999a-11d3-9db5-0000e8dbedce} fail due to the follow error: 80040154 class not regist (except from hresult: 0x80040154 (regdb_e_classnotreg))i there a way to make this to work like in a usual .net application?
