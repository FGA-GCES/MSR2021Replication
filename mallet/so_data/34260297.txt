edited: specifi the use of arrowhelp i wish to generat a larg number of arrow on a 2d plane, to repres a vector field. the number of vector varies, but is typic 20000. use three.arrowhelper, i can achiev this, but it is tremend slow, so i am think there must be a better way. how could i be repaint the field use a subsampl number of vector when zoom out and is there a way to dynam calcul and add onli what the render will need?added:i creat it use the snippet of the code insert below. the loop generat a 2d vector field at the x,i locat of a parametr surface.i just test on a more power machine, where it run smoother, but still take a signific perform hit.i can display and smooth render the parametr surfac and even a 1e06 under textur no problem, but the arrowhelp are caus the perform hit.
