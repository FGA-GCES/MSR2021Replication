i have made a desktop applic which reli on a python backend and a "client" gui applic written in react with electron. to use the applic i have to first initi the python backend from the command line and then launch the electron app. in an attempt to make the app avail for download i have packag the electron and python app as two separ .app files. i then have then written a short actionscript file that launch both apps. however, this launch them as two veri separ app (complet with two icon in the dock), which have to be exit separately.how do i handl the launch of two applic as one unifi app with a built in backend and client "sub-apps"?
