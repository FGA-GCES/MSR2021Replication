i'm develop an applic that will use social login in order to post messag on facebook, twitter, etc., and i read a lot of thread that say that oauth key should be kept on the server side for secur reasons.i know it may sound like a stupid question, but whi is that so? if i creat a facebook applic that is onli allow to manag login and messag posts, the worst thing that could happen is that some bad guy get the key that are store in the front-end and use them to login and post a message, but noth else, so he cannot do ani damage...obvi i'm still tri to undestand how the whole process works, so i'm not an expert yet.for complet sake the whole program is go to be an electron desktop application, and i'm tri to reduc cost by not have a server that doe the work of publish message, not even have a serverless back-end on aws.thank you in advanc for your answers!
