i'm build an applic use the reactj framework in node-webkit. i have a close button that is control insid a react component. after the page has to re-rend (aka, a parent compon has a state change), my window.close() call will fail with: script may close onli the window that were open by it.i'm guess the react state chang and/or render are somehow re-nest my class insid some other file.i have tri use jqueri event system to rout the window.clos onto the html sourc file of the page using: direct on the onclick callback of my react dom element after a re-render.i'm hesit to tear up my react compon just to nest my quit button in the sourc of the page, and would like other possibl work suggestions.
