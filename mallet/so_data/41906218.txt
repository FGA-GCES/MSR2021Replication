i am follow the electron filesystem tutori here:how to choos , read, save, delet or creat a file with electron frameworkwhich includ the follow code to pull up a load file dialog:a you can see, the last line updat the dom with the import data. however, i want to return the data to my call function becaus it isn't html. note the comment line toward the end of the first snipped. that the kind of thing i want to do. it actual xml that has to be process rather than dump into the dom. but all my attempt to return data (notably, return data; either where the last line is or befor the final cur brace) have failed. neither result in the call function get the data.i it possibl that the call function need to wait for this one to complete? or, more likely, i'm just not return the data correct from this type of function. ani help is much appreciated.
