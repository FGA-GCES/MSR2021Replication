so i know this work becaus i tri it, but it not document anywher so i'm ask if it ok to use this practice, and not worri that it would stop work in the futur (electron and nodej are known to break thing from one version to another)thi is the type of practic i'm talk about:main.jsessenti i'm tri to move all the code that doesn't deal with html directly, like databas interactions, into main.j and i want to make sure this is the right way to do it.also, is it ok if i extend the app object with my own method and properties?
