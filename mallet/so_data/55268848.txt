i'm in the earli design phase of an applic and tri to reason about expect and requirements, to make sure i don't spend substanti time down a dead-end. i'v never work with v8 or node nativ add-ons, so bear with me.suppos i were build an electron application. for perform reason some function would be written in nativ code in an independ library, which would be invok from a nativ node add-on. the nativ librari need to execut javascript. so:electron app -> nativ add-on -> nativ librari -> v8first, is this feasible? for example, will tri to construct/run a v8 context fail due to it execut insid an electron v8 context? i'm think deadlocks, aborts, etc.
