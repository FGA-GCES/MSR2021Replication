i have two applications, a node.j app run on node-webkit, and a lua application. i would need to pass data between the two applic on regular intervals, say everi 5 to 15 seconds.th node.j applic is the one creat the data, and the lua applic is the one consum the data. the data onli goe to one direction.how should i do the data transfer. i would prefer json/xml for the data, but actual it can be in ani other format as well. the data move at a time is not large. it just some ten paramet at a time.mi initi thought was to just make the node app act as server and serv the data via rest api, and the lua app just read the page with luasocket or such. but is there a better way to do the transfer, if both of the app resid on same machine? current the lua app is run in windows, but that could change.mi background is in web development, so i'm total lost when it come to share data between applications. i'm also new to lua. thank for ani answers.
