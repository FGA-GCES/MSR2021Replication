i am design a electron app that is gear to look like a browser (i.e., googl chrome), with tab on the navig bar. i want to keep the window style button in the top right for closing, maxim and minim and the border with window color.curr i am use a frameless electron window and attempt to replic the window 10 gui but i am come into a few roadblocks.how do i get the window color?when un-focus window 10 give a window a 1px transpar grey border. ani transpar border i creat is overlay against electron window background and is not transparent.wher can i find the window resourc to replic the top right window buttons? i want this to look like windows, not a custom gui.then come the difficulti of replic this approach for someth like the aero glass style of window 7. is there a better way to do this? say perhap draw direct onto the window border in a way i am not awar of, or is this the onli approach?
