i am use electron with plain javascript to make a singl page desktop app, it is a log tool, which will receiv time seri data via socket from a local program (like a backend, but not a remot web backend, so i don't think the bandwidth will be the issue), and use javascript chart librari to present the data in high speed.th main data flow is like this:socket->array->draw chartssocket->oth ui updat commandsalthough this is a singl page app, it has mani components, so put all the code into one file make the project difficult to extend or maintain, i wonder if i should use a oop way to separ the code into multipl javascript files, like what we usual do in c#. but i have no idea whether this is a good practic or not, will it incur signific perform overhead? same concern goe to the use of typescript, i feel like use it instead of plain javascript, but not sure if it will slow down the app.on more question, i use jqueri to access dom, for example, ?
