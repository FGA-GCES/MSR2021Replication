i'm work on a program run in node-webkit, and i use jqueri for mani other tasks. now i have a settings.json file that i need to load upon the start of the program, and i was think about how to load it. so either i use the node.j fs function to read the data from the file and then use json.pars to get the correct data in a javascript object, or i use the jqueri fnuction $.getjson which in one function get the json file, pars it and return a data object.now i was wondering, is there data on the speed of both? would the jqueri option be signific slower if the settings.json file were to get larger (e.g. when i add more settings) or is the differ negligible? i'm assum here that the jqueri way would be slower than the node.j way, sinc it would seem logic to me that an oper on the filesystem would be faster than a jqueri get request, but then again i could be wrong.anyon who can help me out with some inform on this? i have to add that i'm fair new to node.js, i understand what it doe but i'v onli been tri it out for about a week now so i haven't done ani substanti read or research on ani of it.
