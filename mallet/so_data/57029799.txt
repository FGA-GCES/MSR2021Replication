i am tri to print a receipt from my electron app that use javascript.i know that javascipt doesn't allow print from client side so i have to use a third parti languag or programm to print. i tri qz tray 2.0 but then i face a problem with the certef so now i am tri to find anoth way:for the moment what i need to do is simpl : pass data to a chosen printer instal on window that will use the correct driver.edit :i have multipl printers, connect on the network, so i need to get there ip adress first befor i can do anything. electron doesn't offer an option for this (i can onli get the name and driver but not the ip).but as last resort i can make so the user input the ip. ani idea are welcome, thank you
