i'm develop an app use electron. i'm tri to receiv and react to a window broadcast messag (wm_fontchange). is it actual possibl somehow insid electron? with some extens maybe?th other thing is to updat the electron font cache. i add new font use addfontresourc and other app are see the newli ad font, so it works. but electron doe not react, and doe not see the ad font. i tri relaunch it and clear the cache, but no result. on the other hand, chrome 47.0.2526.73 beta-m (64-bit) see the ad font after a re-launch. i also tri this in atom, and atom doe not see the font.so the question is: is chrome use some method to clear the font cach of some sort? how can i achiev the same in electron? i will be glad to hear ani suggestions.upd 1: as i found out, the window broadcast messag can be hook use in electron. that answer the first part of my question. now i need to figur out how to updat the font list.
