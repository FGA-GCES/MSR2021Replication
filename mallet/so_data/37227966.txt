i'm tri to store html file in the browser for an app built on nw.js or electron.long stori short: i want to make someth like sublim text use a wysiwyg editor (i don't know exact how it works, so i will make a guess)creat a new tab, all content insid the #editor is store inlocalstorage/indexeddb/nedb/pounchdb/limvodb/... as the user iswriting.when the user need to save the file, it store the content in thebrows window, and then it creat the file.if the file alreadi exists, the localstorag content overwrit it.al the magic must happen around the browser db.you might be wonder whi i'm not use file directly, and it becaus the first request: we don't know if the user will save the file, but we don't want to lose all the content if the app is closed.search the web, i find that is bad practic to pass html content through json, but i can't think of ani other solution.. i'd have to use encodeuri and decod when retriev the data to the #editor or the file saved.i'm using:electronangulari don't know yet what db should i choosedig around, i also saw the sync function in pounchdb -> couchdb and it blew my mind away ─it a function to synchron offlin and onlin data use the name db's.is it possibl to store .html file in pounchdb and then synchron it with couchdb?i all this bad practice?how would you do a notepad - sublim text or a «ms word» editor use pounchdb, or nedb, or limvodb use electron/nw.j engine?
