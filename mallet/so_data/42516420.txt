i'm current evalu electron for an upcom project. perhap my question is trivial for someon who has use electron. however, i can't find the answer in the document or mayb don't fulli grasp the concept.i want to have a web app that user can access with a browser if they choos or from a nativ app, if they want to use a usb devic (in this case, a credit card reader) attach to their pc. so, the main.j file would open the remot web app like soi there ani differ in be abl to access local resourc (files, ports, etc, if the page is remot vs local? in other words, can you still access the usb port from a remot host web app wrap by electron the same as if the file were local, as in the case of an instal nativ electron app? i would think it would load a remot page the same as a local but not sure if ipc would still work.
