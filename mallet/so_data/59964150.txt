i'm work on an electron app, with finder sync extension.when applic is code-signed, but not notarized, everyth work excelent. when i add the notar process, no error or warn are shown dure the process, but the extens doe not start at all.what exaclti are the requirements, when distribut extens within app, so that the extens work after notarization?what i have done/tri so far: - the .appex file is ad to the plugin folder in build process - tri code-sign the .appex befor the build, then notarizing, but extexs still doe not start. - tri forc code-sign it in the build process. - even tri not sign it at ll -> notar pass with no issues. still .appex not running. - harden runtim is enabled.questions: - what actual should be the extens appid? appl document for finder sync extens say "be sure to use the same identifi for both the finder sync extens and the contain app" but in a notar document it said they should be the same? - is it the fact that i'm not ad app group that break it? when not notarized, this doe not seem to be a problem.thank in advance.
