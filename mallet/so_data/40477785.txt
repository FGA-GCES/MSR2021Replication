i'm use nwjs 0.14.7, and ubuntu 32bit.i recent updat from 0.12.2, and now the build process seem to be differ or doesn't work.i'v ad my file to package.nw and then append to nw via:cat nw app.nw > app &amp;&amp; chmod +x app then in the doc it say "on linux, you need to creat proper .desktop file."but there aren't ani direct specif for this case, if i tri run nw, it say "there is no applic instal for "share library" files. do you want to search for an applic to open this file?"so i'm assum the .desktop file would fix this? it say you can creat it via a text editor, but i have no idea what i should put insid it. for 0.12.2 the .desktop step wasn't necessari so i'm a bit lost now.
