i am use a websocket to push data from a process (run in the background) to my electron applic (renderer, it a electron-vu app). most this work great, the data is receiv and display instantly.in some cases, however, i notic that the websocket client seem to buffer incom messag and onli trigger the receive-ev after some delay, lead to messag receiv as a batch.to verifi that the server isn't buffer anyth i ran a second connect and simpli log the data (chrome-addon), there all the data is receiv and process instant while my electron applic delay the messages.i am use is onli display with some delay. is there ani configur option, like buffer on the client side or must the render process be call more often..?
