i'm look for a way to implement "plugins" for my electron tool.below is a pseudo exampl of how i'm think it would worksuppli .js/.zip/plugin filefil would contain name of plugin, and it categori (global, team centric, misc)fil would contain html for the gui, which get place in a div design for tool space. this name would be ad as an option to the necessari select, as well as logic ad to pull in the html to the same divin the tool, select the plugin file: page will load the javascript script, and add option to select along with logic to switch to the pluginth hope is to autom my current process.curr i'm manual updat the index page to refer the new javascript script, and to add the option on the selectth javascript script has logic in it look at the select, and look to see if the option was selectedwhich then pull in it own html via a function withini there anyth i can reference/util to make this work?
