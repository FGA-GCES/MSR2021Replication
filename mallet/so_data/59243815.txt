i am port a web-app written with the ionic/angular framework to a desktop app use electron. i would like to keep the web-app code unchang as drop-in code to simplifi maintenance. i have it work well, and i am put in the finish touches.th final touch is to save the user prefer (such as choic of kg vs lbs) between use of the desktop app. the web app allow chang the prefer with button but doe not have persistence. i have figur how to navig the dom dure a window close event to determin what the user has chosen, so that i can read the current state and store it.what i have not been abl to do is set the prefer when the page load at app start. my plan is to add code in event. i can find the button, but call the click event doe not throw an error, but noth changes.it seem that either angular or ionic is creat a context or closur which prevent me from access the method or even the button. how can i access one or the other?
