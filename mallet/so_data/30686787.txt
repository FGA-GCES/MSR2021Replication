sorri for a not veri specif question by someon new to node webkit, new to angular, new to about everyth in web development:mi app is base on a json file that i load at the init of my node webkit app and which is at the center of a bunch of calculations.in the app, one can open a file dialog to creat a new json file. now, of course, i would like the app to recalcul everyth base on the new json. it work when i press the "refresh" button of node webkit, but i couldn't get it run by use either.i am also wonder if handl this on the node level is the good way to do it. shouldn't it rather be done by angular? but i couldn't realli connect to the content of my control from an "outside" javascript.gr for ani hint...
