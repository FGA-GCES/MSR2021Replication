i'm tri to encrypt a local sqlite3 db with an electron app on window 10. i understand that sqlite has to be specif built to target the electron framework use npm. use this link to setup sqlite for electron.now my requir is to encrypt it. after some research, i ran into sqlcipher which is an extens of sqlite. i'm guess my origin sqlite instal doesn't have the sqlcipher libraries, so i refer to these links, link1 &amp; link2 to instal sqlcipher on window use both variat of the follow commands:vari 1:i'm not abl to encrypt the db even after use both variant mention abov to instal sqlcipher on a window machine. these are the instruct i follow to encrypt the db, but i'm abl to see the content of the db in plaintext use hexdump and db browser for sqlite.aft some more search for way to get sqlcipher to work for electron on windows, i found more evid that other peopl have had similar issu and there seem to be no solut for it (hope i'm wrong).i'v download a sqlite cli to interact with the test dbs i'm creat to test db encryption.mi guess is, the version of sqlite i'm instal doesn't have sqlcipher installed, which is whi the db is not be encrypted. how can i get sqlcipher to work on windows? ani links, guid or help would be appreciated. thank for your time.
