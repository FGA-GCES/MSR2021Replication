i'm current use electron with nodej and then use the plugin browserifi to make it compat onlin to make a website. one of the thing i want to do is to have the user upload a file (csv), combin it with a text file that i generate, zip the two up, and then give them a "download zip" option that they can use to download the zip i generated. i would also want all of this to occur client-side.what i need to happen is again:gener a text filehav user upload csvzip the two togetherg the user a link to download zipal client-side.i'v alreadi search onlin for method to do this, but all the way to implement a download link that i found either requir the file to be a text file, or use fs/express or some other plugin that don't seem to work with browserify.if what i'm ask for isn't possible, let me know so i don't wast time!thank in advance!
