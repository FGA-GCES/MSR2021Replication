i have a rather noob question that i can't seem to find the answer for. so i'v heard that all electron app can be turn into sourc code and then manipulated. so that lead me to my next question. if i'm connect to a sql databas then what is keep peopl from view sourc code, go in and do whatev they want to the db? i mean onc they see the sourc code the usernam and password are right there...sorri if this is a silli question but i'm think of make someth on electron that need decent security. i'v also heard php cannot be used. so... ani suggest would be appreciated. i'm just wonder becaus discord, whatsapp and such seem to do it somehow, but how?thanks!
