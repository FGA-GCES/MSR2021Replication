i was learn electron and made a basic electron app and packag it for windows. the app was not show notif so i follow the instruct here on window 10, a shortcut to your app with an applic user model id must be instal to the start menu. this can be overkil dure development, so ad node_modules\electron\dist\electron.ex to your start menu also doe the trick. navig to the file in explorer, right-click and pin to start menu'. you will then need to add the line app.setappusermodelid(process.execpath) to your main process to see notifications.i did as suggest here and the notif start working. they were still work after packag the app. so i want to check whether after a user use an instal to instal this app, the notif would still work.i don't have ani experi with packag software, and i use installforg to make an installer. turn out, after instal the app use the installer, the app still work but notif don't, even after pin the exe to start.i tri copi the build folder (direct build, not the instal one) to anoth locat and tri the same thing and it still works. this also work if i copi the instal folder to anoth location. but it doe not work from insid so i am assum this must be someth about permissions, but i do not understand exact what is happening. i have't check the app yet on linux so i don't know if i would face similar problem there as well.ani pointer would be great, thank you.
