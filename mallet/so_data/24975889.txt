i recent start to play with node-webkit and tri to creat a simpl helloworld + load a module.th modul i chose to test was the getmac (https://www.npmjs.org/package/getmac).thi is my code:i instal the modul normal with npm instal and there is a node_modul folder insid my app folder. all my resourc are insid the folder (there are no other folders, except for node_modul -> that mean no tree structure).when i run this code i get a "modul not found" error. i also read someth about re-build modul with nw-gyp but i don't even know if it necessari in this case (pleas includ someth about this in the answer if possible). anyway, thank for all the help. note: the helloworld doe work without tri to load the module.
