whenev a fresh client is instal the request is generat for firewal access. on new instal it acceptable.a the applic is updated, the exe locat is chang and again the user get a prompt for firewal access. that seem irritating.i there ani solut for this problem?th problem is that everi time an applic is updated, the user has to add (accept) a new firewal exemption. i think we can fix this issu patch squirrel.window in such a way so that window os abl to understand that it the same application, not a differ one on everi update.
