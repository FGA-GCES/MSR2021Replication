edit: reword my question to make it less vague: would run a java app through a jar file on a node child process be slower than build the gui on java? to clarify, i'm not ask if node is faster than java, but if execut a jar through a child process is notic wors than run it nativ in it own environment.i have an app, kind of like a calcul that allow bit manipul and persist data, and i would like to run it through node. the reason for this is becaus i want to releas this as a desktop app and am familiar with react and electron so i want to build the gui with those tools. what is the best way to do this? i have found mani approach but they all seem to be ideal for differ situations. my app will not need to communic to a server to run ani code, all of the logic and data manipul is on the java app, i just want to run it through node so i can creat an interface. here are some of the option i have found:creat a .jar file and run it through a child process.us socket communic and talk on a port (this look like it use most for server communic but can be use on the same machin so i think it would still solv my problem)i have also consid re write the code in node (it not a lot of code so wouldn't take too much time) and also use javafx to creat the gui, but i onli want to resort to these option if they'r signific better that tri to run java code through a node app.
