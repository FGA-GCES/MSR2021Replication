i'm look for a way to autom the electron build for emberj build projects. i have a pipelin where i would clone the built emberjs-project in a specif folder in an electron project which then use electron-build to generat an instal for this project. i need to keep this electron-project generic but the usag of the package.json version for the build and auto-updat is prevent this. is there a way to select the ember project version / tag for build instead of the one specifi in the electron project?or is there anoth way to add/check version of electron builds?i realli wan't to prevent fork my base electron-project for everi new emberjs-project.i tri ad a package.json-fil in the folder where i clone my built project and specifi a version there but this seem to overrid my electron-project package.json-fil which i would like to keep use for the generic script and links.in my electron package.json:mi project structurepackage.json (electron)main.jsresourc (folder contain emberj dist)
