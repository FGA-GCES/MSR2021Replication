doe h2o-3 have node.j bindings? i found https://github.com/h2oai/h2o.j but when i saw no updat in two year i realiz it was for h2o v2.i'm specif ask about deploy a pojo/mojo jar file, in the context of an electron app. i.e. offline, not use the rest api to communic back to a server. (mayb my question is more: could i use the h2o.jar, and a pojo/mojo file, with someth like https://github.com/joeferner/node-java and expect everyth to work together, across each of linux/mac/windows?)fwiw, tensorflow integr seem vapourwar at the moment: https://github.com/node-tensorflow/node-tensorflow, but mxnet seem to have someth working: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet.js/ so, if h2o pojo/mojo can be use from within node.j apps, could deep water model also work?
