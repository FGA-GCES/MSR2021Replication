first off, i tri this simplifi in the browser https://codesandbox.io/s/competent-bassi-yjtoj and it work as expected.in my project i'm use electron, react and mui and plain css. i do not know which of these is caus the issue. it might be simpli that the css / flexbox code is not correct?video demonstr the issue: https://youtu.be/ym9bhgexycsnotic that onc you tri to scroll to the "bottom" in the inner container, you need to continu to scroll which is taken over by the main container; which then scroll to the bottom of the outer container, to see the bottom of the inner container.i tri sever combinations. disabl the outer contain overflow and set it to but i have no idea where those 35px are come from. i remov pad of all elements. i would like to find a real solut which is not base on a fix pixel size .. or at least understand what is actual caus this issue.
