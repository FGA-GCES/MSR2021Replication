i am current aim to creat a veri small scale desktop applic which would featur retriev data base on a simpl search (keyword) and reflect static data link to it. some number to put it in perspective:about 150-200 "key" valuesabout 5-10 valu to be display per "key" valueedit (although the info tend to remain same most of time - maybe1 or 2 amendments/month in total on all data stored)data should be amend by 1 privileg user. (so i would have a db with user &amp; one with the information)an example:card you see when you do a simpl googl search. for exampl you search for an actor (key value) and your queri generat a "card" with valu (age, length, wage, brothers,...).al data would be store on the same drive alongsid the app, so there should be no server interact whatsoever. in python i was use sqlite to achiev this. howev i want to make a sleek desktop app use the electron framework which use javascript.i'm not extrem familiar with js and node.j and the likes, so i am polish up my knowledg and am read a lot on how to use databas with js, but i can't seem to find a concret solution.so my questions:i it possibl to have a sqlite3 kind of databas local with theapp (same drive) control via javascript?or perhap is there a possibl to have javascript communicatewith python and do the databas oper with python?i am familiar how to use python to interact with sqlite, howev i'v not yet touch interact between differ languag (in this case javascript to python &amp; vice versa).i would veri much appreci it if somebodi could point me in the right direct or which area i should look at.
