environment:os: ubuntu cosmic (18.10)electronjs: 4.0.5the electron doc indic there are two event on the menu instance:'menu-will-show''menu-will-close'th doc do not, however, indic how to regist a listen on the menu instanc for an event.on my main applic menu (instanti with menu.buildfromtemplate, andset with menu.setapplicationmenu) i have tri variat of the follow on the menu instanc return from buildfromtemplate:menu.addlistener('menu-will-show', ()=>{})menu.addeventlistener('menu-will-show', ()=>{})menu.on('menu-will-show', ()=>{})(each of the abov specifi the class rather than the instance)(each of the abov specifi the object return by menu.getappliationmenu (in case the menu object i sent is destroy on set, or otherwis thrown away)non of them are triggering.th doc say some event don't work on some oper system where specified, but there is no addit inform on the event document suggest that linux doesn't work.th intent is to check and set menu item state befor the menu is shown.i can brute forc set the item state anoth way, but would rather use this mechanism, if possible.i'l tri on window and osx, eventually, but on linux, it not happening.
