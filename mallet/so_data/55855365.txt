i know that cpu intens work in main process will block the ui process. i have anoth question, doe long time io oper in main process block the ui. recently, i use electron to develop a desktop applic of file management. step 1:mi ui process use asynchron ipc (provid by electron) to tell the main-process to fetch data of file list from network, (on fetch meta data of file, not contain file content)step 2:main-process fetch data of file list from network and then store the file list into sqlite(i use typeorm ), and then select part of the file list from sqlite, and respons them back to ui-processsometim the step2 cost ten of second (for example, i fetch 10000 item of file data from network ), and my ui will be slow down.so, i have two question: + doe long time io oper in main process block the ui ?+ what the best way to do io operation(databas or local file) in electron applcat ?
