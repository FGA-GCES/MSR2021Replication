can an electron app present a persist touchbar layout across applications?with the sampl code here i'm abl to interact with touch bar element while the app is foregrounded, but the button disappear when switch to anoth application.project like mtmr written nativ allow for custom touchbar configur that stay activ across all apps.i don't see a similar mechan for do this within electron. is such a thing possible, or must you delv into swift / objective-c to achiev that functionality?(thi is for a person project so i'm not worri about use privat apis, though again i'm not sure if electron enabl such a thing.)
