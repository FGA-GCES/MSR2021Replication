i have a web applic written in vue 2 , and for the most part we would use it through a browser.i have one page where i need to communic between the browser and the desktop devic ( electron scale and barcod scanner ) - both ways. i have got the event side sort in the electron app use nod-hid and node-serialport packages. my question: how to i communic between electron and vue web applic note: the web applic is host separ and referenc use http://localserverwebapp:2000, not part of the electron app.examples:submit an event from the electron app to the web page , and the webpag know what to do with that event (e.g. one way , such as abarcod scan send to the web page )submit an event from the web page to the electron app , and wait to receiv a responsee.g. ( sequenc ) a properti chang or button click on the web pageelectron receiv the eventsend a command to the electron scale and wait for the responsewhen the respons is receiv electron send the respons back toth web pagei am fair new to view , and veri new to electron , but i can think of a few of way that may be possibl and just need some direction:a) use vue on electron and the web app and use the "reactiveness" of the vue framework.b) use ipc to communicatec) use websocket to communicateani help is great appreciatededit: it seem that websocket might be too slow for this sort of thing.. [quot from the bottom of this page; https://www.scriptol.com/javascript/ipc-vs-websocket.php] while the data is display instant with ipc, there is a notic delay with websocket.som other option i have look at are uwebsocket which doesn't seem to be proper implement with electron and also https://electronjs.org/docs/api/remot , but i think the web applic need to have electron instal as well ( which is what i am tring to avoid )
