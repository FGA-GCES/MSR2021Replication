i'm tri to understand github person access token and use travis-ci and/or appveyor to build my project and put the build result on github in the releasesi'm use electron-builder.th instruct say to generat a person access token on github and store it as an encrypt environ variabl on the ci.what i don't understand thought is it seem like that token is global. instead of give the ci permiss to push thing to a singl repo i'm give it permiss to push thing to all repo (i have over 200 at the moment).i that realli the case?
