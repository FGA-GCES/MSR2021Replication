i am work on an electron applic use for display management. the app is use in malls/restaurants/airport for digit display ads. the electron app intern load a react web-app and then display it. the react web-app come from our vendor who has a platform for display ad from differ vendors. the react web-app is crash in some instanc (it is not abl to find the correct ad etc). i am unabl to debug this crash becaus the console.log messag from react web-app are not shown anywhere.i there a way to redirect the console.log from the react applic to some file? architecture:- electron app is a full-screen contain for play ani content. - vendor provid a web-app, which play differ ads. this web-app is a react application.- vendor web-app crashes, but not abl to see those log anywhere.
