i'm work on an electron app written with angularjs. in the main process of the electron app, i'm listen for the downloaditem events. so, everi time a user download a file, the event get triggered. in my main.js, i have the follow code.thi work just fine, but it feel kind of ugli to handl all of these event in the main applic controller. i would like to separ it to it own control (e.g downloadcontroller). i thought about it to listen for this event in it own servic (e.g downloadsservice), but sinc i want to manipul the view (e.g show some success/failur message) of the app, i don't think this would be the right place for this functionality.so, i'm look for a good way to separ this function to a specif controller.mayb i just do not realli understand the concept of angular and it controllers, so ani advic would be realli helpful.thank in advance!
