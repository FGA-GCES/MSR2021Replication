i'm consid use firebas with my electron app. specif i'd like to begin by use firebas authent to sign user in to my app. i'v done ton of research regard the subject thus far, and my biggest concern remain that the domain i'd requir for an author redirect would need to be localhost (pleas correct me if i'm wrong). the firebas interfac set localhost as an allow domain by default, i assum just for develop testing, not for a live product environ (again, pleas correct me if i'm wrong). the imag below is the section of the firebas authent interfac that i'm refer to, for set up author domains. my question is this, in order to distribut an electron applic with access to firebase, do i have to have the localhost domain authorized? as well, if i do have the localhost domain authorized, is this secure, in the context of couldn't malici user set up their own localhost and redirect to an unintend page, give them the abil to freeli add data to firebas databases? if there an alternate, more secur option than author the localhost, what are my options?i'v read in plenti of place that the bulk of firebas secur come in the form of set applic rule on who can read and write to the database. name this post give some good oversight on the topic. but i'm a firm believ that if there are extra secur measur that can be taken, then alway take them, so long as they don't diminish the qualiti of the application. am i be too paranoid, or is this the right approach? thank in advance! ani advic or guidanc is appreciated.
