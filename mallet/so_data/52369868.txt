i'm do long-run comput in an electron app. i'm "forking" the node process use child_process.fork to execut a script in a separ process not to block the render process. the app is work fine provid that the script i'm launch with child_process.fork is in the directori i'm launch it from. what i'd like to do instead is to ship the script insid the binari (i'm use electron-build to build one).i'v found out that the builder pack everyth (includ the script i'm interest in) into an archiv - can it be access by the binari at runtime?child_process.spawn and use a languag other than js is an option too, but the problem persist - i don't know how to emb the script into the binary.
