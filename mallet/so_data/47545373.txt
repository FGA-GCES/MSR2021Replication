i have creat an applic use electron, one featur of which is that user can add file to it(copi to applic data directory). when user want to open file from applic ui, i am abl to open file use electron . now i want to give user an option to trigger system "open with" dialog(shown below for windows) from where user can choos with which applic user want to open the file. i search doc for electron and googl it but not abl to find a way to trigger this dialog. ani idea how this can be done for all platform electron supports. solut which involv call an os specif command to trigger this dialog is also as good.
