so i want to creat a websit that can also be brows in electron, but where the electron app will have addit function (in this case for download and copi files).what is the best way to structur this project to keep the "shared" aspect of these? should i have the electron app brows the websit itself and just have it own local page for the nativ part (though i'm not sure how to detect that and have link that onli appear for that) or should the electron app have it own copi of the html files? if i went with the latter option, what would be the best way of share them between the two part of the project?hop i'v explain it so that this make sens :)
