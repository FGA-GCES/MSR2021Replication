i'm not too good with promis (first time work with them). with some other help, i'v modifi the code some, but i'm still get a 409 conflict error on the putattachment() method in the readfilethenattach() method. so, i need anoth set of eye to look at this for me. i had been consist get this error, then i come in this morn and tri it again. it work twice (i didn't get the error). i stop the program then when i ran it again, i got the error again. i'm not sure what wrong. the revis seem to be okay, so i'm not sure if it some time issu or what with how the promis are in my code. the execut path of this code begin in the importproject() method and from there importinspectionphotos() is called. can someon take a look to see if they can see anyth that stand out? thanks.
