i'm build a web crawler in node.j and electron.essentially, the program take in a start url, and crawl through to a certain depth, report back where it found certain keywords.thi is work aso far, but i can't figur out how to actual tell when it done. given a depth of 3-4, this program seem to run forever. with a lower depth, the onli way to realli tell if it still crawl is to look at the amount of cpu/memori it using.her is the function that doe the crawling:but obviously, the callback() get call immediately, becaus the crawler hit the depth quick and exit the if statement. all i need is for this function to print out (to the console.log for example) as soon as all the recurs instanc of it are done crawl and have reach the maximum depth.ani ideas?
