i'm build a simpl wysiwyg editor in react and i'v implement all of the differ button function except this last one: select text and turn it into a hyperlink. i need to prefac this with: i'm not interest in answer like "just use react-quill" or "just use react-draft-wysiwyg". so the type of featur i'm tri to implement can be seen on https://quilljs.com/ - scroll down until you see the demo editor, then select some text, click the "link" button, and a secondari window will pop up contain a text input that allow you to enter a url. click save, and the origin select text will turn into a hyperlink. i'm approach this like so: use note: all of this rang save and restor is necessary, becaus when the user click on the text input on the pop-up window to enter a url, the document select clears. so here what i'm see happen: instead of the select text turn into a hyperlink (in this case i was select the word this',) the url is just thrown at the end of the line of text. for reference, after tri my own code, i decid to tri the function implement here: https://gist.github.com/dantaex/543e721be845c18d2f92652c0ebe06aai still see the same issue. ani thoughts?an extra note: i'm build an electron app, so i'm not as concern with "cross-browser" compatibility. if it work in chrome, then great!
