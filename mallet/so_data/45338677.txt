i'm creat an electron app where i have two row of button contain in two divs. the div colour are darker than their button colours, and there is a veri small 2px gap between the button and their divs. the first div, which has the exact same height, the exact same button and is onli slight less wide than the second, has a notic 3px gap between it and it button vertically. i understand than a pixel in css isn't the same as a pixel on the screen, but i was under the impress that a "css pixel" would stay the same throughout the application. the div are in a class with these properties:th button insid them are also suppos to be 18px high, but this valu also differ when displayed, regarless of the fact that they are in the same class with the same rules. i have attach a screenshot to show what i mean.i.imgur.com/kf53nsj.pnga you can see, "x," which is exact the same both time where it is drawn, is one pixel bigger than the bottom div, but the same height as the first div. also, there is 3px between the top div and the button(s), but there is onli 2px between the bottom div and it button (but i want 2px in both cases).solut (?)i don't know if this count as a solut or more of a workaround, but it seem the browser have a particular problem with 22px? i use this html to reproduc the error, and the same problem occured, except when i chang the height properti to 20px, the error is resolv and both div are equal. this is shown here: i.imgur.com/hezdxog.png (i need ten reput for imag and more than two links).
