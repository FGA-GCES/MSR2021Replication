i'm work on a project with typescript, react and redux (all run in electron), and i'v run into a problem when i'm includ one class base compon in anoth and tri to pass paramet between them. loos speaking, i'v got the follow structur for the contain component:when i first encount the error i thought it was becaus i wasn't pass in an interfac defin my props, but i creat that (as you can see above) and it still doesn't work. i'm wondering, is there someth i'm missing? when i exclud the childcompon prop from the code in the containercomponent, it render just fine (asid from my childcompon not have a critic prop) but with it in the jsx typescript refus to compil it. i think it might have someth to do with the connect wrap base on this article, but the problem in that articl occur in the index.tsx file and were a problem with the provider, and i'm get my problem elsewhere.
