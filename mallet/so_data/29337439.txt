i'v look on the node-webkit site and it appear to say that i can make an applic with html5 and compil it for windows, linux of mac so it will run without the need for the user to instal node.j separately. however, when i tri their sampl app (e.g. https://github.com/leanote/desktop-app found on the offici nw.js page: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/list-of-apps-and-companies-using-nw.j ), the ".exe" file doe not run the app (on either win 7 or xp). it just open a simpl browser window with the address "nw:blank" and a gray page say "nw.js" and doe nothing.can these app be packag and run without requir the user to instal node.js?
