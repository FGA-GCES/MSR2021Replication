i'm tri to make a simpl game launcher. launch one specif game and tool app from the list that is user customizable. use electron-stor and showopendialog, i select a tool executable, showopendialog take a full path from dialog and then it made into var_toolnam (simplifi file name, path.basename+regex+replac to cut out part befor first non-lett character) and var_toolpath (just full path stringifi with join()). those both variabl are store in config file through electron-store. one problem is i don't know how to append next tool execut to the list, instead replacing, and i'v been tri for few days.what i expect json list of app insid config.json to be look (just an idea, not specif coding):tools: (so i know it a part of config.json relat to list of apps, overal config.json has few simpl stuff store such as window position, game execut path)toolname1toolpath1toolname2toolpath2toolname3toolpath3and etc.,two role of this json list is to make a html list insid electron app (so user know what tool are go to be launch togeth with game and, optionally, could toggl on/off specif tool and delete, i haven't reach that part yet, i'm guess that would requir some work on electrons-stor and ipcmain/renderer). second role would be includ full path of tool to be launch togeth with game executablescript for select tool execut and save stuff to config.json:curr look of app (list is just a fake filler):
