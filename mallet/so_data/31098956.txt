i have a win32-dll (c++) which is load as a plugin in anoth application. the dll start a nw.js instanc (shellexecuteex and see_mask_nocloseprocess) and end it at dll unload (bi the hinstanc of shellexecuteex). i need a way to send a string (plain ansi) to the nw-process and retriev an answer (also string). the old way was a simpl http-request with the respons in the body. but the environ chang dure the development, the "package" app-dll-nw run multipl time by the same user and multipl user run on the same machin (termin server). so port list is "impossible" (yeah random port or singleton nw, but no).i found differ ways:socket - port list problemwm_copydata/wm_... - need a custom nw-plugin with hidden window (no nativ nw way); no request-response-systemrpc - port list problemdd - no nativ javascript way (found a module, which use .net); in my old delphi day dde was a not so simpl task and it fail multipl time with no logic.shar memori - no experience; expectations: asynchronous, trigger?, no nativ javascript wayshar file - no experience; expectations: asynchronous, trigger (watcher on file change) but problem with synchronization, nativ js way possiblenam pipe - no experience; expectations: win32-api and like a chat system (in-pip [send broadcast] and out-pip [receiv broadcast], or both in one)? if yes, i can use one name about all instanc and use uniqu identifi and wait for the right answer.what is a nice and simpl way to communic like the http-way but w/o networking?upd 1: the node modul "net" is abl to creat a server for a name pipe. the first test, send a string from the dll to nw, was successful.// jonni
