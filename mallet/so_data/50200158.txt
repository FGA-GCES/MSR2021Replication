i want to build a vue.j app with node webkit (nw.js).the app has to exec a binari so i didit has to be link with me use vue.j becaus when i test this code in a simpl node webkit app with just a script tag, it work !is there some kind of incompat between webpack (use by vue.js) and the requir keyword of nodej ?when print the content of require("child_process") there a few thing but noth of what i would expect (no spawn or exec methods). it seem that the requir itself is not work for this specif case. but od it still work for other npm packag that have been installed.to creat the app i use "npm run build" which generat the final file direct in the /dist directory. in this directori i have put the node webkit file so i can just run the node webkit binari from there.
