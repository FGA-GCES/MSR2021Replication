i'v been task at work to creat a chart applic that will function offline. i'v been thrown into the fire with this one as i'm a junior dev and ill be do this by myself. i'v been tri to research the best way to get this done and i'm think electron is the best for the offlin function and d3.js for the charts. i want to use angular for the work experience. befor i begin develop this, i want to test and see if this made ani sense. i found this repo and tri publish it with electron.https://github.com/datencia/d3js-angular-examplesnon of the chart show up however. so i'm sort of in a rough place becaus there no one at work i can ask about this. doe this stack make sense? can i use d3.js offlin with electron?thank for ani feedback.
