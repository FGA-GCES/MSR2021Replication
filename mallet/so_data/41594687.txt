are their ani tool for simplifi ipc and do data marshal between a singl web page and the node.j processes? i have read: http://tangiblejs.com/posts/nw-js-and-electron-compared-2016-editionwhich overview the differ between nw.js and electron. both seem pretti much the same, but i like to minim complex when not needed, so i am lean to nw.js to avoid the issu of ipc.but this might be a mistake, sinc i see 10x more comment deal with electron in this group as oppos to nw.js(mi ide will be visual studio code, which now has an extens for nw.js debug, but none for electron).
