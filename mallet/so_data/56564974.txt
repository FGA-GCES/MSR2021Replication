i need to have a local json file that will work as somewhat of a databas for my project. i have figur out how to read and write from the file, but the problem aris when the file get changed, the app recompiles, which is someth i would like to avoid. i store the file in the asset folder. also, i am not sure what happen to all the folder when the electron app is built, sinc there are no file shown(i'm guess they are "hidden" insid the app). is there a place for file whose chang doe not trigger the project to recompile?
