i'm have some perform issu with react-redux in electron and larg data table. i'v done my own custom tabl which look like this: it feel slow for me, that my applic take 30sec to render 5000 rows. i have no data to compr my speed of my application. i think i'm do someth essenti wrong. mayb there is a better way to profil where my app take the time. edit: i use the electron dev tool and profil the perform of my app. the render part take 3190ms while the most time is consum in the script section with 36500ms. somehow it take a looooong time to creat the child and updat their prop or something. i realli don't understand what i'm do wrong. i will tri to make a version with react-virtu and compair the time after it. perform in electron
