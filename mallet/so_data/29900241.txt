i have a page that emb an ifram with an extern domain. so i can't insert anyth into it dom. the page is run with node-webkit (base on chromium), but sinc this behavior is the same for ani browser, i consid this to be a general javascript problem.i want to prevent user from "drop links" into my page and into the iframe.for my page, i can emb a small javascript snippet that listen to the specif events, e.g. "drop" or "dragend":so far, everyth work fine: link drop into my page won't be navig to. link drag from insid my page into the ifram won't navigate, but still can be drag into an extern browser window (which could be prevent with "dragstart", but it okay for me).but if the user drop a link from an extern browser direct into the iframe, it "hijacks" the whole window - not just the iframe. that what i want to prevent.i set up a small jsfiddl that demonstr this odd behavior (test with firefox and chrome).question: how do i prevent the browser from chang the top location, if someon drop a link into the ifram from an extern window?
