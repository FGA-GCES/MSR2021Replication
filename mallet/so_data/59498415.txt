i'm realli a beginn when it come to html/js, and i'm tri to build a simpl multi-pag app base on electron. as the layout and overal function of the page are quit different, i'v read that i should avoid the the single-pag app approach which is well documented. i want to move from one page to anoth use button and i'm stuck. i'm creat the button in the main page, but i'm unabl to creat addit one when load a differ page.so, the start page is creat with 2 buttons, which will open the page2 and the start page, but no button appear on the new creat windows. as i'm reload the start page, i was expect the same 2 button to appear. also, as page2 point to the same script as the start page, i was expect to see the 2 button appear on page2.ad below the code:package.json:thank
