my scenarioi'm build an app in electron and use laravel as an api for authent user / other functionality. i'm not sure howev if i need to worri about secur in the same way. the reason i say this is becaus laravel implement a csrf (cross site request forgery) protection, but my electron app isn't a site essentially, it an app. and if i was to worri about csrf just as an example. how would i go about creat a csrf token use plain js.mi questiondo i need to worri about thing like csrf (or anyth like this) when use softwar like electron. if so how would i go about make a csrf token in js to meet these needs.mor informationyou can use in the app, but everywher i look it not advis to sinc it run on window but you need an apach server to run php function and script els thing start to get much more complex than need be. so i have to build the app use js/vuej etc. that whi im use a host laravel server as my api (and also becaus im realli familiar with laravel).
