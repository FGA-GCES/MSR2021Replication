i am write in an undo and redo method for some softwar that is be written in nw.js. the softwar add element to a dom. i need to be abl to use “fs” to somehow find a file in a specif folder that is titl with the highest number and grab that name as a variable. the file that are put into the undo folder are name with unix timestamp so the highest number is the most recent undo point.i have use “ctime” in my function that retriev the name of the newest file in that folder but ctime seem to be a round number becaus if i add thing to the dom veri quick one after another, mani undo point (files) have the same "creat time” even thought there was actual a few millisecond differ between those file be created. so, i need to be abl to get the file with the highest number from a folder in nw.js, mayb somehow loop through all the filenam in the folder and do some logic in a loop. i onli have this so far...when i use .slice() i get an error say .slice() is not a function.
