so basic im work on a project use electron and canvas. i have a function that i call 60 times/second (use setinterval) and everytim that i want to draw some new thing i creat a new file with the draw method and i have to call that function insid my main loop. there ani way to load all my "scripts" without call each one, one by one, on my loop function manually? so i could just throw they on a specif folder and they would be load and all instruct insid a draw fucntion would be call on my main loop? kinda like a script engine. i dont know if im use the wrong term but i tri to look around and didnt found anyth like that.
