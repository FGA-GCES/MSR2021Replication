so what i'm tri to do here is bind onclick event for each of my titlebar button (minimize, maximize, close). when i run npm start i keep get back "document is undefined" and i'm not realli sure why. i'm pretti new to electron so and i don't realli have a ton of experi with node either, so this all seem kind of weird. i'v seen a coupl other ask similar questions, but none of their fix seem to work for me. i read somewher that app.on('ready) doesn't mean that my dom is necessarili load when deal with electron. i'm hope that if this in fact the case someon can explain how to handl access this situation. as i understand things, my current code should onli bind event handler to these button onc my dom is loaded, and yet document still isn't recognized. i have also not rule out that my problem isn't complet unrel to what i'v just described. this is all quit new to me, and the frustrat is mounting. in chrome someth like this would be relat benign and easi to implement, but here it seem there a bit more to it.her is my javascript:
