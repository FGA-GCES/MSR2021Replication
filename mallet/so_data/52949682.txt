in mani electron-angular tutori you creat the window and load index.html from localhost after a timeout. typically, you'll find text like this:// set timeout to render the window not until the angular // compil is readi to show the projectnow i think there must be a way to not just arbitrarili wait for ten seconds, but to have some kind of event to act upon.unfortunately, loadurl return "true" even if the localhost is not yet reachable, so win.once('ready-to-show') is also call when, actually, it not readi to show.ideally, i would like to have a load screen until the angular compil is ready. ani ideas? thank you!
