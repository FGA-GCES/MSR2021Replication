my project use zerorpc as communic protocol between python server and nodej client. but a strang thing occur when the client invok a time consum method to server, server stop respons everi time when the respons size in a fix number. however, if i use consol to run "python api.py" individually, then run "npm start" to launch my electron project, everyth is correct and not stop response.in python side, i alreadi use stream mode and yield result to client which should be not as heavi respons at all.launch electron project and spawn python automatically:https://imgur.com/jlivdunlaunch python first and then launch electron project:https://imgur.com/y3btubsmi python server (on show the main function)
