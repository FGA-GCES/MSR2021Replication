in my web app, which is base on electron, i use indexeddb. if i copi the entir project over to a separ directori and run it while the origin copi is running, the indexeddb api complain that it cannot open the database. onli if i close the first app will the second app be abl to run without problems.thi rais the question as to how indexeddb treat files. even if i give each databas their own name, the problem still exists. electron use the file protocol for access urls. how doe indexeddb handl normal web app that don't use the file protocol but rather http/https? clear each app has it own databas and can access it without conflict with other databases. so whi doe a file base web app behav differently? is there anyth i can do to make both copi of my app work with separ indexeddb databases?
