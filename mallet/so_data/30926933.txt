i'm build a nodewebkit app that keep a local directori in sync with a remot ftp. to build the initi index when the app is run for the first time i download an index file from the remot server contain a hash for all the file and their folders. i then run through this list and find match in the user local folder.th total size of the remote/loc folder can be over 10gb. as you can imagine, scan 10gb worth of individu file can be pretti slow, especi on a normal hdd (not ssd).is there a way in node to effici get a hash of a folder without loop through and hash everi individu file inside? that way if the folder hash differ i can choos to do the expens individu file check or not (which is how i do it onc i have a local index to compar against the remot one).
