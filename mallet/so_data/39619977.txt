i'm a littl lost as to how to make the app wait until the client has network connectivity. the consum of the app are not expect to start the app manual (they will not be veri comput literate) and the app will start up automat on a user login to the windows/linux/mac machine. in such a case, how do i ensur that dure the user session on the computer, the app start as soon as internet connect is available. one option i am use is the node-main paramet provid to run a script befor launch. my code for the script is :-&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;hello get log but then my app start load and fail as expect due to the lack of internet connectivity. ani other idea to implement this ?
