i am veri new (coupl of days) to html/javascript etc and i have start learn ui design with electron. i know how to creat button and can handl what they do when pressed.what i could not find is a way to input someth in electron js. for exampl i want an input field where i will type a number and a button next to it, that when click should save this number for other uses. in normal javascript on a browser i know how to do this, in fact a simpl "prompt" can also serv my purpose, but unfortun even prompt doesn't work on electron ! what is the simplest way to achiev what i am tri to achiev here ?
