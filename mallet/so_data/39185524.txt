atom and visual studio code are probabl the biggest electron app so far and they'r both quit extensible, and the are other smaller exampl like n1. by extens i mean, they support plug-ins.th problem is: i thought i would find someth on googl on how to make an electron app extensible, or someth on those cool "awesome" lists, but i found nothing. besides, dig into these app source-cod would take a while.what i'm look for (or):a built in featur that i'm not awar ofa librari like (fake name)a guidelineso, how do i make an electron applic extensible?
