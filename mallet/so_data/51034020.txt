(environment, ubuntu 14.04, electron 1.8.3, ide：vscode)i'm develop a electron app use typescript, react, the target in tsconfig.json be configur to es6', use webpack to package.her i find a strang result when i use the clearinterval(testtimer) doesn't work, the loop away log 5'.i tri to find the reason, and i found that here is the problem, the setinterv in es6 is differ of nodejs, in es6, setinterv return a number id, but nodej return a object(nodejs.timer), the clearinterv use it correspond parameter. so i guess when my code compil to js, the setinterv &amp; clearinterv mismatched, such the setinterv use the nodej interfac so return a object, but clearinterv use the es6 interfac paramet need a number.i debug it in electron dev tool, my guess is right, setinterv return an object(nodejs.timer).but! this phenomenon doe not alway exist, i tri recompil my code use anoth computer(similar environment, but ubuntu version is 16.04), it work normally, clearinterval(testtimer) worked.i also debug in dev tool, setinterv return a number, so clearinterv worked.anoth phenomenon show as the pictur below,in pc_a（ubuntu 16.04， work will）when i declar testtim as number, the tslink warn me it should a timer', but the webpack compil and packag work will, and the clearinterv also work will. bu if the testtim declar as timer', the compil will failed.thi means, in work will computer, webpack will use es6 interface.in pc_b(ubuntu 14.04， work wrong)declar testtim as number, compil failed!declar testtim as timer,compil success! the phenomenon is just the opposite.so, my question is as the title, how to specifi setinterv interface, i want specifi setinterv use the es6 interface, so, the code in differ environ will work the same result.
