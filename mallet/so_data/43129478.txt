this leaflet exampl (leaflet.tilelayer.pouchdbcached) is use an "idb" adapt and for electron/nod it look like i want to use a "leveldb" adapter. so i follow the instruct here: pouchdb in node.j in node.js, the adapt situat is much simpler than in browsers. by default, if you creat a pouchdb like this one: var pouch = new pouchdb('./path/to/db'); then a leveldb-bas databas will be creat in the directori ./path/to/db. the leveldb implement use leveldown.in my "main.js" (electron entri point) i creat a db like this:and though the adapt type is report as "leveldb" it doe not show up on disk.question: where is the databas created? i'v look in my app directory, in the node_modules/pouchdb directory. i'v even look for "hidden files" (this is on osx). what gives? if i dump the db instanc to the console, it look like it was creat (in memory). am i "do it wrong"?
