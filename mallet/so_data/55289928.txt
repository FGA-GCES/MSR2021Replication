is there a way to use chromium switch after start it up, or must they be enabl on start up? for example, can switch be pass to the render processes, or just to the main process?i want to turn on paint flash in chromium (actual in my electron app which run on top of chromium).devtool has a checkbox that turn this on, but i want to be abl to turn this on without devtools, and after the app has started.i know there a flag that live in someth call the "compositor," but that may be irrelev for me.both of these work, but sinc chromium use a multi-process architecture, i'm hope that there a way i can specifi that switch, or otherwise, turn on a featur in one process and not have to specifi it at startup.i there a way to do this in chromium? (would be ideal to do this in electron, but i'm not count on it)
