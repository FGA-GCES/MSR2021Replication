i am creat an app that use almost the same code base. we are still in decis phase, and thing can change. so far for the desktop we plan ot use sqlite, and for the server version we plan to use mssql.ideal it would be great to use one db for both sides. i just recent heard that mysql has embbed mysql db.i have lot of problem with maintain the sqlite on my project, and i think use the mysql would be ideal. i have few quesiton regard this topic.if i were to use mysql embed db, do i have to compil it same as sqlite?ha anyon ever done it?th desktop verison is go to be self contained, without need for internet connection. thus, whatev embed db we choose, must be 100% embedded.
