i have some memori problem with my electron app.on startup the memori usag is about 120 mb. the js heap stay constant at 32 mb. without perform ani action in the browser window, the memori usag of the render in the task manag goe up by about 1 mb everi second. after increas by 20 mb it seem to go down by around 16 again (propabl gc). but leav the window open for sever minut result in 300 mb memori usage. so there is a memori leak somewhere.sinc the js heap size never changes, i assum the leak in insid the node process, am i correct on that part?how can i analyz the memori usag in the electron/nod process? (sinc the chrome profil doe not seem to help in that case)rel to https://spectrum.chat/electron/general/debugging-high-memory-usage-in-electron~80057ff2-a51c-427f-b6e1-c297d47baf5b and https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/perform
