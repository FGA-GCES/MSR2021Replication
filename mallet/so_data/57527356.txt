i'm current use excelj to read larg excel file (10,000+ lines) into a nodejs/angular/electron app. it read the smaller file just fine, but the larger file take anywher from 3.9 to 5 second to read, and dure that time, the css doesn't updat at all. i'm current use async/await to load the files, as i thought that would allow other oper to happen while wait on the file load, as i thought i/o oper in node had their own thread. i also read that cpu intens task block all other node processes.thi is the code that current load the workbook:thi code work the same as the callback implementation, they both block the app css. how would i go about read a file (or do ani cpu intens task) without block the ui?
