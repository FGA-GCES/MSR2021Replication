i need to develop an app which reli heavili on usb/serial, webaudio and potenti other usag of hardwar apis. at this point, this app is meant onli for a window 10 tablet, so it should also support touch &amp; gestures. but of cours i'll happi to decoupl the app logic from windows/uwp api in order to be abl to extend the app to mani other platform in the future.i'v chose to wrote this app use typescript &amp; angular, but realli undecid about the framework combin i should use for this purpose:1) should i use onli pure electron-angular-hammerj combination? (and mayb deploy it as uwp app)2) should i involv ionic framework in order to support touch &amp; mobil better? or this combin of electron with ionic will bloat my app unnecessarily? 3) doe pure ionic (as uwp app without electron) support window usb/seri capabilities? i found so far onli usb-cordova plugin for android... 4) doe ionic capacitor serv this app purpose? on the one hand, this framework tend to support mani platform includ electron, but on the other hand it core librari doesn't includ usb/seri api, and even if i'll chose to write generic plugin for hardwar usag (like usb) there aren't much document about creat capacitor-electron-plugins... i'll happi to your opinion, becaus current i'm veri confus &amp; don't know what to choose...
