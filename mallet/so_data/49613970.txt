i'm current tri to implement the toolbar which is fix to the right side of the screen. initi state work fine. when i tri to dynam chang the content width from the app, browserwindow is resiz well, but there a blink on the wrong locat due to the delay between setposition() and setsize().to get a better idea about this:i there a way to either set the posit and width at once, chang the anchor point from top-left corner to top-right, rerend when it all done or anyth els that would prevent the app from blink when chang browserwindow width when do this?th way i current do expand:: recalcul posit becaus we want it to stick to the right border of the screen and expand content from right to lefti'v alreadi tri with setbound but it result in the same delay between this 2 actions.
