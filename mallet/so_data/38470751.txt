the node-pre-gyp document say that the command line has a option, to build the librari for node-webkit or electron. i would like to use this option, but there are a coupl of issues:in my binding.gyp file, how can i check which of those option were used? some build option need to chang for it to work proper with electron.how can i make sure that when instal under election, it download the electron packag instead of the node packages? the version section of the document list sever variables, but "runtime" is not among them.
