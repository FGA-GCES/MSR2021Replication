i'm current build c++ addon for nodej so that i could expos some of the c++ api via websockets. this api let the client talk to composit devic connect to a pc (or even pi). sinc it will be deploy on pcs i'd like to bundl it as a standalon app. i'v use node webkit (nw + nw-gyp) for poc. this work fine howev move forward i'd like to break the ui layer as a separ deploy and the layer which expos websocket api as a separ deployable. but current when you build an app with node-webkit it includ the browser as well which make a "big" deployable. i realli don't need browser included. is there anyway to say to node webkit don't includ the browser? i'v look at jxcore as a possibl altern but it still a veri young project and i'm not sure if it can support c++ addon either. is there a better way to build standalon node app (with no ui) which has nativ addon as dependency?
