look to better understand the way to approach my desir goal. build an electron applic that will perform processor intens tasks. i would like to util multithread design use the approach of creat a hidden browserwindow() for each task. i am current use electron-webpack and webpack-dev-serv for development. i am have limit success at the moment. what would be the best/cleanest way to have the follow architectur that run both in develop and product mode.desir architecturei current have main.j and renderer.j work well. now i am attempt to run addit browserwindow that will perform more processor intens task, but i am not sure on how to get this working. i did find a good exampl here of electron background processing, but this doe not involv use electron-webpack and webpack-dev-serve.i was think to have my src code like this tag to prove the html is load is not show in the window. i don't need ani html to display, becaus the window should be hidden and i onli wish to use the window to run processor intens javascript code.
