i'm write an electron applic which need to send quit some data everi ~25ms from the render to a separ node process start in the main process with the nativ instead of pars to json (from ~4ms to ~1ms).so the websocket solut is work great, but there a problem: it need to find a free port and go over the local network. in maco this also trigger a dialog: do you want the applic "x.app" to accept incom network connections?thi dialog in combin with the tricki of use the local network is someth i'd like to avoid if possible.mi question is: doe anyon know of a better solut to send data to other process in electron that doesn't go over the local network?
