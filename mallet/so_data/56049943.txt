we have our own in-hous patch solution, use node js with our client appliat be electron.our patcher assembl a diff list of filepath chang between versions, and pair them with a generat sha sum to save to a json. the sourc file are be store on a local server on the network that all build machin can access. currently, our window build machin is assembl the filepath and sha hash for both window and osx build due to it be much faster than our osx build machine, and then pass off the json inform to the osx build machin to complet the process.when upload file from osx to aw use the follow command use the follow libraries, we are see that the result sha generat after subsequ download no longer match the origin file that oper were be done on. doe anyon know what happen here or what command are mess up? we are onli see this on osx, wherea the exact same code is be run on window with no issue. the sha generat method we'r use on both patcher and client is from node nativ crypto library.https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.htmlour patcher upload to s3 is use the uploadfil function of:https://github.com/andrewrk/node-s3-clientwhil client download is use electron intern downloader:https://electronjs.org/docs/api/download-itemfor client-sid file moving, we'r using:https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extrain this fashion:i tri use the move operations, but that result in crash on osx.thank you.
