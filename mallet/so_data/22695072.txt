right now i have grunt setup to watch for file chang and feed them to mocha, and mocha run the tests. the problem is when modul includ someth like "nw.gui" the test case cannot find them. is there ani way to get around that, some way that i can includ it?should i do this differently? i did think about run the test in a gui window in webkit, but that would requir that i includ all the spec file on the page and reload the page everi time i want to run the test. with grunt and watch i was tri to get it to run the test for each file when i edit either the spec or the src file.i will also need to test the html/js/backbon page that i open in a webkit window.thank for ani insight.
