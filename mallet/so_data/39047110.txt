so i recent updat to the newest version of nw.js (nwjs-sdk-v0.16.1-linux-x64) and tri to port my current project over to it. attempt to debug some of the script (a librari i call "bunny.js") i notic that my code will be shown under "applications" but not in the sourc tab like i am use to. this would be fine if i could debug from the applic tab, but appar it just a monitor of sort not actual meant for interaction. a pictur (blur code becaus it not finish yet):i this just a new nw.js thing? i feel like i am either miss someth obvious. if someon knows, pleas let me know what go on.
