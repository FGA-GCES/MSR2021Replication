i want to creat a desktop applic with a gui such as the imag provid but unfortunately, tkinter with python doe not allow for such customisation. from my research, i see you can use html / css through electron to creat ui for desktop applic and i'v also seen peopl design websit with adob xd.could i potenti design a ui with adob xd first, then code it with html / css through electron? i am not too sure as i have not seen anyon design desktop applic ui use adob xd, however, how would one go about design an interact ui such as the imag above?i know a littl about python, noth about html, so i kind of understand i have to sort of "bind" the function to the ui. this is the design i want to make in electron js:
