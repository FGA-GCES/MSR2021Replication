say i am build a desktop applic with react/redux &amp; electron. so my index.html file in electron look like this:mi biggest react contain (call it app.js) is load into the id=cont div. this work fine so far, but now i am wonder how to open a new file dialog window (or ani new window for that matter) when the user click a button in my react application.i found some exampl here &amp; here, but both exampl onli explain how to load the file dialog window from the main electron process (in render or main). however, i want the user to engag with my react applic and then, onc he or she click a button, my app should then tell electron to spawn a new window, and this new window should, of course, somehow be part of my react application.i would realli appreci it if someon could provid a minim exampl here, on how these to thing work together.
