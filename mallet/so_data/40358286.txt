i need to replic a desktop applic which current build an catalog for coins, medal and banknotes. it main featur are:scan imag from a scannerserv the imag to an imag edit program for some minor adjust (brightness/contrast)th possibl to scan 2 imag and stitch them togeth to one. (e.g. 2 side of a coin. side a left, side b right)gener a "printable" pdf file (printabl means: 300dpi and cmyk profiles)i know my way around the web stack (javascript, html5, css, php, mysql) so current i am look into build an electron app. for the scan i found these:clscantsscandynam web twainright now i am tri to estim if this could be done with electron/nodej and one of those command line tools. as for the catalog pdf generation, i found some pdf-gener lib and npm packag but all of the seem not to fit a printer press requirements. in the worst case i autom my indesign workflow more and build the catalog insid indesign, but if possible, i would like to creat a "one-click" solution.th app will be use on window 7. to cut a long stori short: am i "out of my league" with this kind of challeng and my set of skill i have at hand? or is this possible?
