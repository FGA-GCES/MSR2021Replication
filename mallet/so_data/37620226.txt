i am new to typescript so apolog if this is a simpl question.i am tri to build an applic to run on electron (http://electron.atom.io/). i have ad the type declar use type (https://github.com/typings/typings) - use the env: electron typings.thi seem to be fine. i can now import declar from type as needed.however, i am tri to creat an applic menu for my application. the method i would like to use is creat a "template" object and use the menu.buildfromtempl method (http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/menu/).th problem i am face is that the type definit for the menu.buildfromtempl specifies:thi give me an error: " argument of type '{ label: string; submenu: { label: string; accelerator: string; role: string; }[]; }[] is not assign to paramet of type menuitemoptions[]'."from this, i thought that i need to cast the templat to menuitemoptions. however, i can't add menuitemopt to the import as it not export in the definition.i this an error in the definition. should the menuitemopt also be exported? or, am i do someth wrong.i can provid full sourc if needed.
