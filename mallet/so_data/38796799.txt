i'v creat an electron app which is effect a nativ wrapper for my web app, with some nativ integration. when the user click on extern link i creat a new browserwindow to load the request. if i then click on the main window the secondari browser window get hidden and it is no longer obvious that the second window even exists.if i right click on the app dock icon it doe not show that there are multipl window associ with the app. do i have to add new window to this list manually? i see that there is an api to add file to the recent document section of the dock menu, but noth about list windows. is there a way to make it so that my open electron browserwindow instanc appear in the dock menu as shown in the imag below?thanks.
