so i have multipl client use an app built in electron. the entir applic is actual a number of electron window that talk to each other. when i have an updat for the client side code (html/js/css) i have to have them shutdown, and run a util that download from our intern server to updat their app. i would like to know if there is a way i can either push new code to the client (mayb through a socket) to overwrit the old code, or even mayb poll our code server for updates, and then have it automat update/overwrit exist code.i this possible? is there function built in to electron that allow this?and, if possible, how can it be accomplished? i.e. is there a librari i can look at that will help me?? (i found a filesaver.j library, but it not exact what i need). thank in advance.
