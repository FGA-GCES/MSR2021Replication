i am curious about the use of mlab with electron. read this articl it seem like mongo cannot be bundl into an electron application. i am wonder what that mean and if mlab would be the same thing.do bundl mean for mongo config that use the db locally? i would like a solut that has an onlin manag system that i can access if i make say a react nativ applic or a pwa as well as the local electron app. is there someth els i should be look at instead to meet this need of data prescience. the applic i am build would need to save quit a bit of data so local storag in the browser api wouldn't work for me and i realli like nosql.what are your thoughts.
