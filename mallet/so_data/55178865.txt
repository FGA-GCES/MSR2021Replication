my goal is to build an electron app and be abl to easili edit resourc in the packag app, and see the chang in the packag app without have to repackag the whole thing.i'm use electron-forge, i have the follow structur after a build:th applic is use data from .cach folder (and don't care at all about stuff into src folder, i wonder whi this folder is copi in the packag btw ...). i would like to know if it possibl to tell electron to use data from the src folder, instead of .cache?th idea is to creat a kind of basic app abl to execut some javascript, jqueri and an access to the file system. so i can give this packag to my work mate and they can modifiy the sourc to adapt the applic to their own needs, without need to instal all the stuff i have on my own pc (nodejs, electron etc...).bas they (and i) should be abl to just modifi index.html, main.js, index.css, reload the app, and see the change.i this possibl with electron? and if so, how ?
