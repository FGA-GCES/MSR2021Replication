i have a node.j project built upon electron-vue, which util electron, babel, webpack, and vue. i have built a simpl vue spa, but i have found that the single-thread natur doesn't sit well with the larg amount of data fetch and process that it need to do.mi first idea was to creat child processes. i creat a vue compon that spawn and manag the child process:, they appear to work properly, but i would instead prefer not to have babel separ instal from my app. accord to http://node.green, these should be compat under nodej v8.1.2.how can i take advantag of these features? is there ani better way to structur my app for what i'm tri to do here?
