follow some tutori to get angular 7/typescript run with electron and the app runs, but i'm tri to get vscode debugg to work. my error is vscode "correspond javascript file cannot be found". even when i chang my outfil to point to the absolut path it still can't find main.js. the .map file are there right next to the .js files. i have 2 theories:1) the tutori had me transpil the electron file into a separ folder under dist from the angular file (both have main.js) so wonder if it get confused? i'v tri point to the exact electron dist folder but didn't help.2) i'v read that sometim the project is creat the wrong type of sourc map (mine have readabl json key but the map list is nasti looking). doe anyon know if this is the correct format? it seem like a big ordeal to tri and generat a webpack config to modifi this set so i don't want to do it unless i have to! {"version":3,"file":"main.js","sourceroot":"","sources":["../main.ts"],"names":[],"mappings":";;aaaa,qcaa6c;aac7c,...from launch.json...
