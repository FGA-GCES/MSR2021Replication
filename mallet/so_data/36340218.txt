i'm an experienc programmer, but relat new to nodejs, nedb, mocha.nedb is a nodej npm modul for small data usages, that replic some of the interfac use in mongodb. i chose it becaus i'm build an app to run on a beaglebon black or raspberri pi and didn't want the overhead for mongodb for my small data needs.however, i'm have a problem with the path portion of the filenam for nedb. it work fine if the myapp.j i'm work on is invok local to the current path, but if i invok it from a differ directory, like my mocha test directory, then nedb won't work with the same path. it won't work with relat path either; i have to specifi the full path, start with /home befor i can get it to work from the mocha test directory. needless to say, this is both inconvenient, and prohibitav for production, as it not run with a base of /home in production.in the code that follows, myapp.j is the applic i'm develop and testing. usemyapp.j is a util test to use myapp.j for simplicity. these are all in the same directory, and work proper when i invok usemyapp.js.myapp.j is locat in /home/geek/project/public/javascripts/her is the code for myapp.js:thi work as expect when i invok the test against myapp2.j with the full path.th question:how do i resolv the filenam path issu with nedb so that i don't have to chang it between development, mocha testing, and deploy to production?thanks!
