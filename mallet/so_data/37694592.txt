i start develop a desktop-class applic use electron, and am refer to the starter app as well as the electron api demo app. this applic has a singl screen with multipl sections. interact within one particular section can caus other section(s) to get updated. these interact must be in sync with an under model [object]; two-way data bind could be help here.what is a recommend way to achiev a multi-sect window with each section interact with one another? should i compos the layout use div and css, or is there a librari that i can use effect with electron? i was think about handlebar or jade but i am not sure if i need a templat engine, as the entir screen is not render and onli particular section will be updated.
