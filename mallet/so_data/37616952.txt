use electron 1.2.1 and electron-packag 7.0.3, after build the icon for the browserwindow is not show up for linux (ubuntu 14.04 x64), it the ? image. if i don't creat the asar file then the icon show up. if i check to make sure the file exist when i launch the app it say it exist and i can even use the fs modul to copi it outsid the asar file. so the imag is there but it not be use by electron when within the asar file.if i have the file outsid the asar file and chang the path to the browserwindow icon config to match that file, it still doesn't pick up the icon so it not whether the file is insid the asar file or not, it if the app is load from an asar file.i'm use a simpl example: is a png 256x256 file. tri with a 32x32 and 64x64 png file but still no luck.ani idea on what is go wrong?
