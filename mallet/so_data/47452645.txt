when i set proxi set in the system my electron applic get it automat for common request (axio package), but not for websocket (socket.io-cli package). if i provid proxi set manual then websocket start to work too, but i want to tri to avoid manual configuration, becaus it may be tricki to the real app users. so i'm look ani way to get proxi set from electron and transfer them to the websockets.i have tri to use login event for my browserwindow in the both main and render process, but it doesn't trigger at all. is there ani way to get proxi set that electron uses?
