i want to creat an electron app that will use webview to display 3rd parti content.i would like to be abl to intercept all request and respons from this webview. sometim i would like to manipul this content, other time i would like to log it, and other time i'd like to do nothing.a one exampl for the responses, mayb a web server will respond with typescript code, mayb i want to take that response, and compil it to standard javascript.i have look into this page but it look like it is onli possibl to cancel requests, and manipul the headers. the webrequest api doesn't look to fit the need of my use case sinc it onli allow veri minor manipul of request and responses.i have also consid set up some time of web server that can act as a proxy, but i have concern about that. i want to maintain user privacy, and i want to ensur that to the web server that host the 3rd parti content it look like the request is come from a browser like environ (ex. electron webview) instead of a server. i know i can manipul request with the header i send and such, but this whole solut is get to be a lot more complicated, then i would like, but might be the onli option.ani better way to achiev this, and have more control over the electron webview?
