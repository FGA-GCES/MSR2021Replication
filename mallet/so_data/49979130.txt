i'm current work on an experienti project build a sound recorder.i will use an arduino with a button to start/stop recording, so that there are no interact with the machin (a conceal window laptop) at all for the end user.look for a way to record the sound on the machin from a microphone, ideal in javascript.th sound should be record local (no depend on wifi connection) and each sound should be save as a separ file.onc the project is done/installed, i will have no access to the machin ani more so the file need to be easili access by a non technic user (henc the arduino/laptop combo and not a raspberri pi for example).mi fort is js so i was hope to do it use electron but i haven't found a way to do this just yet.i have tri the obvious which doesn't work on electron for secur reasons. there are a number of librari out there but the one i saw won't work at all, are outdated, and haven't been updat in years.i also tri use p5.js, which despit be a bit convolut work quit well, but requir user input when save the audio file, which is not an option given the instal will onli have one button to start/stop record an as interface.ha anybodi done this or is anyon abl to put me in the right direction?
