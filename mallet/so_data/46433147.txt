i am develop a imag capture/storag softwar for school photograph that use an angular front-end use electron to make it a nativ cross-platform desktop app. the app will need to have onlin and offlin access. i will run a databas on the client machin while offlin and when onlin access is obtain it will sync to a cloud base database. in the futur i want to be abl to have the option for enterpris custom to run the applic on premis and link to their own databas as well. i was look into use either sails.j or loopback to do this. do you think one of the framework would be better for my particular use case? i would assum that both framework would be abl to sync the offlin data from multipl client to the master cloud databas use transact easily? ani input you have would be appreciated! thank (also would react and redux be a better option for the font-end with electron oppos to use angular?)
