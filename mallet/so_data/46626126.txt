i built an electron app that allow drag file in, with a jqueri script that just take some info from that (path) and add an li to a list. that it. it work great.then i follow this guide, becaus the next step is to send that inform to a python script that analyz the file (mayb relevant: when instal zerorpc i built from sources, didn't reli on the prebuilt fork that avail there).now i get this crazi bug where when i drag file into the app my mous pointer chang to not-allow and the drop event doesn't fire. it so weird.i don't have ani code sampl to give becaus i can't realli tell which part is wrong. the onli chang i'v done are the one in the guid i linked, and they have noth to do with the front-end. i'm realli confus by this. not-allowed? why?
