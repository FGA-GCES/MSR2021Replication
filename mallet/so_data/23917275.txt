i'm work on a node-webkit desktop app for window and i'm tri to find the best way to allow the user to save an html tabl view as a pdf from the application. the applic has to run out of the box, so i can't ask the user to instal ani third parti program to get function working. i found a coupl of solut use wkhtmltopdf and phantomjs, but am unabl to figur out a way to integr them into the project so they run out of the box(if that is even possible). i got the node modul pdfkit work within the project, but that doesn't convert html. so my question is is there ani solut i could integr with node-webkit that would allow me to save html as pdf out of the box?
