i'm use atom/electron for build an app that has visualis over video base on data. each video has a correspond csv file with inform for each frame. the video are about 100 minutes, so the file has plenti of data!th problem i'm have is that it take a coupl of second to load and pars the file. most of the time this is not a problem. but i need to make playlist of part of videos, and load the whole csv file each time a video is chang is not a viabl option. i been look to file stream option as fast-csv, but i didn't manag to start read for an arbitrari part of the file. edit: from the fs documentation. in this case, the question is how can i know which byte correspond to the posit i want in the file? option can includ start and end valu to read a rang of byte from the file instead of the entir file. both start and end are inclus and start at 0.what do you think would be the better and most perform approach to this situation?in concrete:i there a way of start to read a stream from ani part of a csv file?do you consid there is anoth storag method that would allow me to solv this problem better?update:in the end, i solv this by store the data in a file in binari format. sinc i know how mani column the file has i can just read straight from the segment of the file without ani perform implications.
