i am build an app in electron-vu that requir load a 56mb json file (from a third-parti that get updat everi few months) on launch but will be use throughout the entir app life cycl and will be queri a lot by the render process(es). the json file is store on disk between each update, so it onli download onc everi few months.load the file in the main process is pretti fast but load it in the front-end take 8-10 seconds! i don't believ this is reason for a relat small file.i have tri load the file in main, attach the result object to the main window and retriev it use remote. this caus the app to just hang. i'v look into ipc but it seem you can't send messag from main to renderer. i'v also look into stream json parser (oboe.js), but i don't think it would be a benefit sinc i realli need the top level element at launch (i can't do anyth with nest element as they are parsed).do anyon know of a faster way of load json in the render or perhap a way of share the pars object load by main?thank in advance.
