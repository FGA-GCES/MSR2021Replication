in my electron application, i have a .showmessageboxsync messag box with two button that display if the user doesn't have a internet connect or not. the messag box itself works, but the button on the box won't fire the function like it is suppos to. when i click "tri again please" button, the box just closes. it doe the same with the other button. i'd like to test the internet connect again if the user would like to, so i tri to call the execute() method again, but to no avail.her is my code - ani ideas?thanks.
