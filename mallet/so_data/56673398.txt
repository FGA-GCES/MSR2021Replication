i'm creat an audio player use electron and web audio api. my current approach for open and play audio file look like this:us with nativ dialog window select audio file - it load file path to local storag (applic store)click a "play button" read the file and convert it to array buffer so the file is accept for web audio api.usually, it work fine enough. when i use file over 5mb the open and convers shown abov tend to take too much time.for exampl open 9mb file took ~3seconds. this solut is unaccept and i have some addit questions.should i "preload" audio file to local storag when they are be open in step 1 (open dialog)?i electron with web audio api not effici enough to creat a desktop player work fast with local files? (i hope not)
