i'm run an electron applic on a singl core window 7 machine. it seem whenev i do almost ani file i/o with the fs library, the cpu spike to ~100% for the electron process and it can take up to a minut to perform the file i/o.on function that is particular slow is fs.readfileasync(). the file i'm read is veri small, but it seem to take a realli long time to perform.i'v also run this exact code on window 7 with dual core, window 8.1, window 10, and ubuntu 15.10, and none of these oper system run into this problem, it onli seem to be singl core window 7 machines. (so i'm almost posit there is no problem with the code written).do anyon know whi this could be happening? is there ani solut to this problem? it seem odd that the number of core affect an electron applic performance. again this is onli window 7 though, so singl core window 8.1, or window 10 machin do not exhibit this behavior.
