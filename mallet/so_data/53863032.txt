i have been read through the electron secur documentation. https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/securitytri to understand how i should write my code securely.from my understanding, i should use the webprefer and preload script to access featur that will access the file system.i want to have a button that open a file picker.i have tri use the preload script but as far as i can tell the script never load or runs. can someon explain to me how the preload script works?wher doe it load or where can i look in the chrome dev tool to check it has loaded?when doe it run, befor the page load or after?can i still refer funtion in the script from the html file?thi code doesn't work. the version number from the index.html don't display but caus error in the console. the console.log doesn't run and the button event doesn't work.
