i'm look at use realm for a project i'm work on which will be a multi-platform mobil app which will need to sync data between user / devices. i think the realm mobil platform would be perfect.however, i also need to have a admin / web app. i'v seen that realm has a react-nat modul so i can use react-nat to creat my mobil app. question is can i also use react (or react-native) to creat a web admin app or even a desktop version use electron?!.. in effect the admin app sync to the same realm the mobil app is use via the realm mobil platform.hop that make sens - thank is advance..
