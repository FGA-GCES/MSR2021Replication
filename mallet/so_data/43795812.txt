i'm tri to creat a launcher for other programs.that mean i want to have a bunch of links, each set three differ variabl that, when joined, would creat the path of an executable. let say pre-path, main-path and launch-commands. and the execut would run.i'v look around about "how you run exe through javascript / electron" but the exampl i saw are of "singular" solutions. as in, the code you'd put in a singular, specif link, to launch a specif application.how could i go creat a) code that set three variabl for each link and, if clicked, call a function that join them in a path and "run it" and b) this function?
