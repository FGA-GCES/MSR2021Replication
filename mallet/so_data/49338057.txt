i feel like this is such a basic question but i have been at it for hour and seem to be spin around the answer. i have an electron app which i also use create-react-app on. i have imag file in the appdata folder for the electron app and i want to be abl to display them in the render (use react) use an img tag.i cannot seem to figur out how to do this. use an absolut path and file:// for the img src doesn't work. i also tri to regist a custom protocol but can't seem to get it to work, i just keep get file not found (see below). ani idea or link would be appreciated.
