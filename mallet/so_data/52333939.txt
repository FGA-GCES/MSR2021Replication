i have an angular application, where you can calcul a coupl of thing and final generat a result page which can be printed/ export to pdf via window.print(). this also work total as expected.but we built also a desktop version of this applic with electron now. if i want to print/ export the result page in the electron app the window print popup open (compar this image) where i can onli choos a printer but there is no option to export it to pdf instead.i there ani way to still use window.print() and add a posibl to export it to pdf (basic like the window.print() version in the web)?
