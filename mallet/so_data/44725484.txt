is there ani way to use nightmar (the nodej module) to press an arrow key? either by send the key to the specif element or by click on the element and send the keypress to the page as a whole?mi problem is that there is a dropdown menu which, when click on, display some option below it. these option do not appear to be clickable, i have tri click and even the realclick nightmar extension. neither seem abl of select ani element of the dropdown. while play around with the page, i found that by use the arrow key and the enter key, i could select the option without clicking. so is there ani way to send the keypress event to electron? either through nightmar or by access electron directly?
