i'm current tri to use electronj to build a wrapper around microsoft portqri cli to automat check for connect to my compani servic (activ directory, outlook etc.) and have a better look gui. (i like bootstrap)th plan is for my electronj app to run the cli local and get the output. i tri use node-cmd but i can't get the output to show.below are my electronj files:index.htmlso the portqri is suppos to run, and chang the p tag to display the output instead. but i can't get this to work. i was think of see if nodej child_process would work, but i can't seem to be abl to import it into my code.ani help would be great appreciated!
