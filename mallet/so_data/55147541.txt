could someon help me to choos a right strategi to work with activex in electron application. i need to display activex-es, call method etc. obvious it is no way to emb activex in html on chromium (like ie does), so i need other solution.i found general three solutions:1). extern nativ app that act as local http or websocket server; electron app use ajax or websocket to instruct the nativ app what to do (display activex, call method etc). problem: need to deploy and run an extern app, communic general insecure, all that seem unreliable.2). creat a nativ nodej module. nodej is emb in electron app, so call a modul is easy, no need to maintain an extern application.problem: i need to display activex. nodej is not made to direct interact with ui, this is a backend. am i wrong?3). chromium nativ module. almost no info how to use it with electron.would be grate for ani comment or consideration.thank you!
