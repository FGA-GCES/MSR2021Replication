i am current build an electron applic with angular use electron-forg tool and i am in the process of compil the angular code in order to bundl it. i start to implement aot compil but i got stuck becaus i have not find a way to use component-rel paths, that aot requir (if interested, more on this issue).on the other hand, i was wonder if doe it worth to make aot compil for an electron application. as, angular offici document state in the aot compil cookbook:most of the abov reason have to do when use a browser client. one can tell that smaller angular framework download size could be a benefit and this realli depend on the applic in question.
