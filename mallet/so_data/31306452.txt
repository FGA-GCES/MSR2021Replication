this issu relat to chromium/node.j (atom electron, node webkit, etc) base app and not chrome browser base apps.when debug the boot code of a program that use chromium and node.js, there is a signific delay between the time that dev tool is invok and it actual start up fully, includ the abil to execut break points. this mean that in order to debug boot logic of an app, which occur immedi after dev tool is invoked, insert or store breakpoint don't fire for this boot code.th onli workaround i have found is to add an adhoc timeout use in the same folder as package.json.to tweak the tests, iwaittimeout in renderer.html. my work around logic set timeout to 100 milliseconds. this can be squeez on my system but it like comput and load dependent. pretti messi solut imo.would be awesom to have an event fire like devtools-breakpoint-readi or someth similar. the logic abov can like be optim a bit. i just start use electron last night. same issu is with node webkit.
