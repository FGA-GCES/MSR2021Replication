i'm develop an electron app that is run an instanc react vr. the app enabl a user to add and save content to a react-vr project by read and write the state from/to a json file. dure development, this json file has been store in the root directory. however, if a user is to download and use the app on their computer, the json file need to be move outsid the app packag content folder.i have tri use , and i can move the json state file there success upon run the app. however, i don't know how to have react-vr access this file, especi sinc there is no access to the comput file system. however, all i realli need is the user system usernam to includ in the userdata file path.what the best way to go about retriev the usernam from within react-vr? would there be a better way to persist user data instead of a use a json file to keep track of the state? would it be worth consid use asyncstorag in conjunct with a database? mani thanks.
