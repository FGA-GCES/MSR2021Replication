i creat an electron app that record audio with an audio worklet node by store the chunk into an array and later on send the record chunk to the main process to write a wav file. the worklet doe also comput meter and check if valu clip howev these comput take place in an async function without the process function wait for it to resolv to prevent buffer underruns. furthermor for direct monitor the input stream is connect to a media stream destin node. this whole setup work pretti good most of the time but for a small amount of the record audio file there are signific click nois at random part of the files. the strang thing is that you do not hear these click sound at the direct monitor output. when look at the wave form of the file it seem that some sampl are simpli miss what also show up in the spectrogram:waveformspectrogrami measur the time the process method would take for each run and log the part where it would take longer than 2.9ms (128 sampl / 44100 khz mono => ~2.9ms) and sometim it took longer than that but the click nois would not appear at those parts. is it even possibl for the web audio api for buffer underrun to appear or is there some intern buffer and the latenc just get wors when this happens? i just can't figur out where the click come from. below are the relev part of the code.worklet code:&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;
