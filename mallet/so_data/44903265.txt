i have develop an electron app with cytoscape.j for graph analysis. currently, i am in the process of refactor the code base and move function to extern modules. current i am battl with the variabl scope.i have a number of variabl that chang when a user interact with a graph.i load differ ui (buttons) depend on the type of analysis.issue: i cannot pass the recent valu of a variabl to a modul in a way that will simplifi the code.th follow code show the core issue.what i want to do, is to move the button declar and relat function of each configur in modules. then call those modul base on the app configur the user has selected.
