i want to let the user select a html element via the devtool in electron. i know that you can get this with the variabl $0. the problem is that it onli access in the dev tool console. i look into the chrome devtool protocol and found runtime.evalu which has a paramt to includ the command line api. this seem to work with everyth except $0 though. i can call clear(), $(), and other stuff. but $0 is undefined. i also tri get to the element through intern dom represent with dom.getnodeforloc but i don't know how i should get to the actual element with that.$0 be undefin seem like a bug to me, but i'm not sure.
