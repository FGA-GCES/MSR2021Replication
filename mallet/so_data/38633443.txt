what is the best way to manipul dom within an electron app?i made some tutori from doc use ipc and webcont with no luckmi app is so simple, i just want to use the web like a consol and show messag (render proc) com from the result of sever sync function (main proc)i updat the question with real code.i'm go to put anoth code, more simpl to see and more simpl to test (i think), is real code and work (but not like i want)when i launch electron onli write the last message.ok, the respons is realli fast and i may not see the first messsag but to discard that i put a settimeout and a larg for() loop too, to make the uppercas function take longerindex.j
