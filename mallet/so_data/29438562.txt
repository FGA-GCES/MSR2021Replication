descript of the problema npapi plugin will be deprec in chrome (mayb in firefox too soon) and be part of a project (webchimera) that is base on an npapi plugin. i'v been think of differ solut to keep npapi support in browsers. (as port this plugin to nacl is current impossible, but the plugin can be use in a frozen version of node-webkit that current support npapis)so i was wonder if it is possibl for a browser page to open a node-webkit app on the user pc, then use js with/without jqueri to send data about the html element where the node-webkit window (with alway on top set) should be to the app (mayb through a websocket) to alway posit it there.i know i can get a html element size, posit in javascript, i also know i can track the scroll of the user and browser tab chang to do the necessari chang to the window size, posit and visibility.th questionth thing that truli stop me from even attempt this is how would i know when a browser is not fullscreen, and how would i know the browser posit on the screen if it is not fullscreen either from the on page js or from node-webkit directly. anoth thing that should be a concern is what screen is the browser window on.am i the onli one that has thought of such an endeavor with node-webkit, are there ani open sourc project attempt this?ani thought or comment on this would be great appreci as a solut to this would not onli save npapi plugin in the near futur but will also open a world where node-webkit can also be use as a viabl solut to build browser plugin too. :)
