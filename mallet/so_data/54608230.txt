i have an app with a few compon that are each display differ data asynchronously. i am use routerlink to navig between the differ components. the issu is that if i am current view compon b when the data in compon a changes, the dom is not updat with the new data when i return to compon a. (the ngfor list will continu to display test1, test2 instead of the data received.) however, use console.log, i can see in dev tool that the data is still be receiv by compon a when i am view compon b. if i am in compon a when the new data is received, the dom is updat and the new data is shown correctly.i there someth i need to do to ensur that the dom is refresh when navig back to the component? i suppos i could probabl detect navigationend and assign the data to itself. is there someth i am missing?thank in advance, here the code: compon a
