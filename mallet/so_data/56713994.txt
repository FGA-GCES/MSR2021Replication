i have an electron app that use the webkit speech recognit api. if test in the browser, everyth work as intended, but if run in the electron environment, the speech recognit api doesn't work. what i mean is that when i press the button that start the recording, the record won't start in the electron environment. i believ that is becaus unlik when run the code in the browser, i wasn't ask for and therefor not grant microphon access. so my question is then, how can i request access for the microphon in an electron app? thank in advance!
