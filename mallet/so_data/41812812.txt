i'm write an electron app, but it a question about javascript/html5 in general. i want to load local content in a webview and then open ifram from particular remot resourc insid it. unfortun i can't becaus of x-frame options. so i came with a workaround. the idea is to load the remot content, eras the dom and inject my own local content use custom file protocol to emb local resources. basic i want to total eras everything, no matter what is load into the webview. i got the eras the dom part with document.write(). but how could i unset all variabl that could have been set by that page? or could i prevent the document from be written to in the first place? or is there ani better, less hacki way to do what i want to do? this is my current code which eras dom:it run from a preload script, befor anyth else:i also tri compar object.getownpropertynames(window) befor and after the dom was loaded, but someth tell me it not the best way to do it.update: i manag to solv the problem more elgant with @woxxom help. i post my solut in the origin github issu https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5036
