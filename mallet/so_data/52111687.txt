just a quick question: i'm build a react/electron app and insid the react app i'v got a few async/await call to an api. these call are made with axio and work fine when in development.when the app is wrap in electron, the request return with a "400 header required" error. when run a dev version of react it call the api correctly.ani idea whi this is happening? i came across the webrequest electron method https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-request. it look like i could intercept the request and chang the headers, but it seem strang to have to do that.thank you for the help!
