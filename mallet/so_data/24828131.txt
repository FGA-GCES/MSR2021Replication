i'm develop an app which use multipl ifram "mini browsers" insid of a normal node webkit window (as describ here). the main node webkit window is a local html file. and the ifram minibrows will navig to extern websites.al was go well until i tri to implement a back button for each of the ifram browser (each ifram minibrows need it own back/forward buttons).th problem is... when there are no page left for an ifram browser to go back to, and then the back button for that ifram browser is press again, the "back" event break out of that iframe, and caus the parent window and the other ifram browser to go "back" as well.thi is problemat becaus the parent window and the ifram browser need to retain separ styling, etc (some of this style is chang by the user at runtime). and this style is lost due to the abov mention issue.thi is the js i'm use to make each ifram browser go "back"....etc. etc.i there a better way to accomplish this, so that the back button for each ifram minibrows never affect the other minibrows or parent window, no matter how mani time it pressed?i found a partial solut to this problem here --> ifram back with javascript - avoid main page go backth problem with the abov solut though is that it not reliable, due to the reason explain in that thread.i there a better way to do this? or ani other workaround?thanks!
