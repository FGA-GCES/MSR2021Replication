the applic i'm develop will allow user to choos video file via nativ file chooser or drag and drop. the app will render a card to let the user trim the video, and set an output directori for the trim video (use ffmpeg to manag the video manipulation).i plan on store the path to alreadi "queued" or chosen video in a .json file in appdata to preserv the app state on close. the onli network request will be outgo to upload the file to youtub via https with oauth and won't have ani ingo request (everyth will be packag with the applic with nodeintegr disabl per the electron secur guide)i allow file:// request via electron in my case a secur concern? if so, what could some step to close said concern be?
