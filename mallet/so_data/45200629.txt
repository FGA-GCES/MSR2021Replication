i have the follow situation: i have a angular cli app, which is start by npm start. this oper may take some time to finish. after the start, the app is avail at localhost:3000.w then have an electron app (made with nativefi module) which make an app out of the url localhost:3000.th problem aris when i start the angular app and, in parallel, the electron app, with a batch file. obvious the electron app will show an error as npm start is not finish yet. on the other hand, i can't execut npm start and the app sequentially, as the end user should not see the cmd window of npm start (which i hide with a vbs script).ideally, the best solut would be that the electron app and npm start fire on parallel and the electron app would show a load screen while npm start is performing.i have liter no idea how to achiev this. could someon address me to a solution?thanksfabio
