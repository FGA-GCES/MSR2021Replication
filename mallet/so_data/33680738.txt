i am work on an api through which i should be abl to add a list of user as jira watcher (so i am talk to the jira rest api)her is the function to do this:th vote object has the list of user shown above. now the problem is that when i execut this function, due to async natur of node, the for loop get execut complet then all the async call get fire at once. (which doesn't work for me sinc the jira rest api doe not seem to support this)i want to chang the abov code so that i make the call to the addwatch function for a user one at a time &amp; make the next addwatch call for the next user onli if the previous async call has returned(. i.e. move on to the next async call one by one for each user and not fire all call to addwatch all at once.)how can i do this?pleas advise,thanks!
