i have exist react app which are publish to product web server but i want to run them from the desktop use electron. however, i do not want to disturb the react app package.json. i attempt to decoupl an exist onlin tutori by paachu on medium but was unsuccessful. it kept fail tri to locat "main...chunk.css" and other resourc need by the react app.with that said, i have a work react app in directori ./projx/reactapp i would like to creat an electron app in ./projx/electronapp that will build and creat a packag execut use electron-builder. the dev environ is not necessari at this time in that i onli need a releas packag to distribute. here is a package.json that almost works:i think the solut is with electron-build if it would allow you to inject the ./src/electron.j into the prebuilt reactapp\dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar. i could then copi the reactapp/build directory, inject into the asar, and call electron-builder.thi by far (imo) is the best start setup (boilerplate) i have come accross:https://github.com/nateshmbhat/electron-react-ts-starter/
