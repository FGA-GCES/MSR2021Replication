run electron 1.4.3, i'm run into a bizarr problem that look like the event loop is somehow get stuck. i'v set an interv to updat everi 80 milliseconds, but after about 30 second it sudden updat onli onc everi 10 seconds. here some log from when i was test it with a once-per-second interval:a you can see from the last hand of lines, the interv sudden goe from be everi second to be onc everi ten seconds. in my testing, i found that it quit consist after about 30 second that it goe to updat onc everi 10 seconds.however, this issu appear to be system-dependent. we'v test this on a linux machin and couldn't reproduc the issue. we test it on a coupl other appl laptop and they, like my appl laptop, exhibit this strang behavior. also, the issu appear to depend on where it is run rather than where it is built - build in osx for linux then run in linux did not have ani problems, but build in linux for osx then run in osx did have the issue.i also tri downgrad electron to 1.3.3, but that didn't fix it either.update:i definit suspect some osx shenanigans. i previous wasn't use a browser window, but while tri to attach a debugg i end up open a browser window attach to the app. as soon as i did that, the throttl did not happen. however, if i put that browser window behind someth els (so that it isn't be rendered), the throttl happen about 30 second later.so how can i prevent osx from throttl my (current ui-less) electron app?
