i am work on a littl cross-platform software. currently, i am using: angular cli 7, electron packag and a backend in java spring. in particular, i need to creat a pdf file start by angular side (i am use jspdf). my goal is to avoid the os request of the locat in wich the file will be save (for example, if i use .save() function of jspdf from angular), but i have all the inform that will fill the pdf file in an angular specif page. for completeness, i'll post what i am tri without ani success. here is my main.j file:so, in a few words, i am tri to pass a pdf file from angular to electron side (channel print-to-pdf), save it with electron and then show it again with angular. i think that to save in a silent modal i need to pass through electron (if i am wrong, and i am hope that, i think it could becam a lot easier)i there some way to silent save from angular or, in alternative, to pass a pdf file from angular to electron?
