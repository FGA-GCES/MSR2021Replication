backgroundour electron app reli on, depend on context, certain http-resourc to be either avail or not. it necessari to halt further code execut until we'v gotten the result from whatev method we use to figur out the resourc state. we'r use async/await and have wrap most of the app setup in an iiafe.we'v been use the wait-on npm packag for poll the resource. but if await from within an async function it never stabil and keep fill up the event queue. while wait-on has return and code execut is allow to continue, electron never fire the app.readi event. probabl becaus it wait for an empti event queue.rel github issu for wait-on: https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on/issues/24hav tried:in an attempt to get around the problem, we implement our own way of poll the resourc use promis and settimeouts. while it doesn't have the same problem in a vacuum â€“ not allow the process to terminate, it still block the app.readi event from firing.gist with exampl code: https://gist.github.com/arzmir/573cd7e0951528bc8905fe3cbac1a83fsom pseudo code for the electron parthop someon here is abl to shine a light on what we'r do wrong and/or tip for workarounds.
