i'v built a fair complex graphic user interfac for a data analysi pipelin that a neurosci lab is using. i built it with python in a jupyt notebook use and various interact plot librari such as bokeh. it basic just a gui for an exist python analysi package, but mani research don't have ani or suffici program skill to use it and henc need a gui.th problem is that it a fair involv setup process. you have to instal anaconda, instal a bunch of libraries, launch a jupyt notebook server, etc. this instal process is not feasibl for peopl with minim tech skills.how can i packag and deliv my jupyt notebook app as close to a "download and double-click the installer" type of setup as possible? it need to be easi for non-tech people. doe the new jupyterlab offer anyth here? could i packag it as an electron app some how?
