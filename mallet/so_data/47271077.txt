update: thank you veri much for daniel repli below. i'v howev found rollup.j to be answer for me. it can handl necessari circular depend between class in project well (webpack struggl with that), work straight on the es6 modul format and veri easili output code both for node and browsers.hi (: what is good practic for typescript code when have larg amount of class that might be use both in browser or in node? do you put multipl class in singl file and treat them as namespaces, or is there anoth way?i'm a main c# use programm look into use typescript for a new project. i see that i can compil intern modul into a larg .js file use refer and --outfile, or use extern modul with commonj or amd. tradit i'v place each class in an individu file, and this feel natur in typescript as well. however, let say i have 200 class in my project, this yield 200+ file to download when run in browser, which seems... excessive.
