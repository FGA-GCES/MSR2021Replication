tri to render a list of max 400 item in flexbox-lik manner (breakpoints) in row with multipl item side-by-sid - depend on the avail width.i am use material-ui compon and had to start use react-virtu becaus of perform issues. each item is a small piec of ui that also expands/collaps with some edit functionality.i have been tri to (mis)us the (react-virtualized) tabl and calcul the number of column dynam (base on screen width) and sprinkl my item over each grid cell. i cannot seem to get the column to align next to each other on one row - i must be do someth veri simpl veri wrong. look at the sampl too, but i could not see ani signific differ compar to my code.i would rather use the exist flexbox (or grid) css servic to get this working. i just do not know how to integr this into a virtual list/table.her is some code of how i tri to call.let me know if you need to see specif code/details.
