i have creat an app that captur time and mouse/keyboard event use electron. it work fine on windows. however, it be block on mac os (see prompt below).becaus of this, mac user won't be abl to use our app - unless they enabl it by go to set > securti &amp; privacy. this is not a good user experi becaus ideally, we want them to be abl to use our app after instal (like how other app would behave)i'v read that this is common for app that track mous and keyboard event becaus it similar to a keylogger. to clarify, we did not creat a keylogg but a time track softwar like hubstaff.comi there a way to bypass the securti &amp; privaci step so they can use the app immedi after installing?bi the way, we have one option that we haven't test yet: -get the app verifi through the ev code sign certif like https://www.instantssl.com/extended-validation-code-signing-certificate.htmlwe'd love it if you can help us get in the right direction.
