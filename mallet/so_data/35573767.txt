i have a node.j server applic that store it data (small, as in "few kb") in nedb. i need to have more than one instanc with synchron data. as nedb was not design to handl replic i need an altern persist data storage. main requir is consist between instances.mongodb seem to be obvious choic as nedb implement subset of mongodb api, but spin up a mongo cluster just to handl few kilobyt of data seem to be excessive.what are replicating, strong consist persist data storag altern (for few kilobyt of data), prefer with nedb-compat api?
