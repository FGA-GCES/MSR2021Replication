i have written a very, veri basic electron applic - the standard hello world type, where you basic have a html file which say "hello, world" - and that live in the "app" directori within electron, and then is load via main.j when you run the app.now, let say i want to be abl to mayb communic with either of those process (main, or renderer, prefer both!) from the javascript within my application, can that be done? i can't realli find anyth onlin about it - but my main problem might be that i don't realli even know what to be search for in the first place. i am veri new to electron.
