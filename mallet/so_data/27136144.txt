a benefit often mention (e.g., here, here) about html5 localstorag is support for offlin apps. however, the same-origin polici make me think that an app at foo.com won't see the same localstorag as it would if the user download the html file of the app and point their browser to those file on their local drive. (the same-origin polici is also restrict with app load from file:// urls).mi questions:mi web app must read/writ localstorag and be usabl offline, still reading/writ the same localstorage. is the correct way to support that an app manifest? i.e., if i use an app manifest, when the user tri to visit foo.com when offline, i think he/sh will get the cach version, and yet the domain will still count as if the user were online. is that right?i assum that this doe not work the same if i creat a local app use a wrapper like atom shell. i.e., the same-origin polici will mean that the user will not be abl to access the same localstorag insid the wrap version of my app as they would from their browser. is that right?
