is there a way to restor main window in an electron app to a certain size? to explain what i am tri to accomplish, let me give you an example:when i open window explorer, it open with a certain size and at a certain position. then i maxim that window and close the explorer. next time when i restart the explorer, it open in the same state as when i close it i.e. in maxim state. howev when i click on the restor button, explor restor to the width/height and posit befor it was maximized. i would like to accomplish the same in my electron applic as well. howev that is not happening.what i am do is when my applic closes, i captur the dimens (width, height) and posit (x, y coordinates) of the applic window use (this is also work great. howev the onli option i get now is maxim the window. i'm not abl to find ani option to restor the window to a size befor it was maximized. for example, let say the user launch the applic with 1024x768 px dimensions. user then maxim the applic window and then close it. when the user relaunch the application, it open with the size it was close and the onli option i see is to maxim the window. what i am look for is an option to restor the window size to 1024x768px. i look up the document here: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md but unfortun couldn't find anyth there.
