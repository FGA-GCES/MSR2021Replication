i'm work on an electron app that can send sysex (system exclusive) midi messag to a midi devic and everi time i tri to send the sysex message, the render crashes. i can send non-sysex messag (noteon, noteoff, etc..) to the devic without issue.her a bit of what i'm doing:in the web browser, chrome only, you need to have a secur connect and request user permiss to be abl to send sysex messages. i'm wonder if these two web midi sysex requir are caus this crash as i'm unclear on how to satisfi these condit in the context of an electron app.
