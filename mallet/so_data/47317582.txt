current i'm am tri to facilit communic between a desktop electron app and a remot web applic embed in a electron webview. for secur purposes, nodeintegr must be kept disabl on the webview.however, ipcrender requir node, and therefor ani event listen on the webapp side must be load in a preload script. this is undesirable. a work around i found is to simpli expos to the web applic the ipcrender itself. like so:somedesktopscript.jsi feel as though this isn't a good idea and may open up other secur issues. if so, is there a way to resolv this, or a better work around i am unawar of that achiev the same result?otherwise, is this safe to do? my knowledg of how much of a secur liabil electron ipcrender is, is limited.
