i am consid use electron to develop a desktop app that captur comput activ with mac. i plan to use rescuetim api before, but the user research project i am work on requir more detail comput usag data. now i can use global-shortcut to regist some actions, but i could onli run it on main process not render process. i also wonder if i could detect when user switch task from one applic to anoth like switch from photoshop to chrome, closing/minim a window of anoth application, etc.? doe anyon have ani idea on how to do it? or is there ani api/packag avail for that use? (ps: robot.j seem relevant, but it is too complex and requir ton of dependencies, which is too complic for my project.)
