i am tri to use atom-shell, but i don't understand how the dom event differ from a normal browser. i can't find doc about it either.if i add:to index.html, it seem that atom-shel doesn't captur the event, and instead forward the call to the termin in which i ran atom-shel myapp.i there ani document somewher about how the dom event work in atom-shell?edit: this onli happen when i run atom-shel from the termin window (in osx). if i run the app by first start the atom applic and drag my app insid the drag area, then it work fine...
