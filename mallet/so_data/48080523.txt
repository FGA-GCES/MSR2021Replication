i have a web site i'm develop that use identityserver3 to authent with, and it also return an access token to enabl access to my apis. all work well. i'm now rewrit the web site into a standalon window exe. the exe is written in react and electron to make it a standalon application. my problem is: i call the author endpoint to my identityserver3 server, but i do not know what to put in for the redirect_uri requir by identityserver3? sinc my exe is standalon it has no uri address?i there a way to use identityserver3 as an api, where i can send the author url to identityserver3, and have it return the access token as a respons (to the api call?)
