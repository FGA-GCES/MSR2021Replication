given an app, i have a help button that in the control class open anoth browserwindow with the help document file in it. when i close the help window first, everyth is okay. when i close the origin window, the help window stay open, and then when i close it it crash sinc the control itself has alreadi been removed. i'v tri various way of use ipc messages, but one way i think i could solv it but i haven't figur out how to broadcast a close messag to all open windows. just shut the app down use app.quit() or app.exit(status) when the origin window close doesn't seem to close the help window either. here a snippethome.htmlani direct would be appreciated.
