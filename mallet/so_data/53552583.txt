a small introso i'v been play with the googl map geoloc api in a cross-platform electron and web application.us the no-longer-that-new a quick search on googl reveal a good hand of project misappropri arch key for themselv already.in addit to this be an obvious gape hole in the key manag on arch-chromium side, the issu stretch much further than that. you might have notic that the google-maps-app on mobil also work without gps servic enabl (and therefor most like fall back to the ip-bas api). now assum somebodi revers engin that key. what can googl even do? blanket-ban everi singl instal of google-map seem suicidal. forc a patch to replac the broken key onli postpon the issu until it broken again.a verdict?it seem like there are some golden api key float around the internet. some belong to big companies, some belong to open sourc foundat and some other belong just to regular people.for most intent and purpos these are not realli of ani great interest to us as developers. if we make mobil applic we get gps, which is far more accur anyway. if we make web applic we get to use the golden api key of our user browser vendor (that may or may never run out of it quota). we onli start to even notic that these mechan exist if we make desktop applic that reli on locat data (which, on the surfac of things, seem silli anyway. desktop are suppos to stay on desks, not move around). but everi onc in a while you may run into this issue, and you'll have to ask yourself the moral (or legal?) question wheter a key store in a gpl-licens file if open for grabs.
