our compani is plan to buy the ev certif for code signing. we have automat build that should perform the signing, but from what we read, continu integr tool will not work sinc the certif come with a hardwar dongle. i'v seen the workarounds, but most of them requir either a window machin or script to sign the apps. it feel a lot like a hack.how do compani that have mani product sign their apps, they can't be do it by hand, can they? what tool are there to autom the process? i mean there should be some softwar with an api where you can pass your file and it spit back a sign version of those files. or someth that could split the build process into multipl machin or containers.how do you guy do it?
