we'v got a big problem - a billion scatter tool across sever platform make it hard to maintain and distribute, or get new peopl up to speed, make deliveri etc.th idea is to tri to consolid all of this into a central repositori that is access by a frontend gui system, where all of these tool and servic are plugin into this gui system.w would defin interfaces/hooks/callback for plugin creator to use these generic area of the frontend to put their app specif data into. for example, when an app is instal as a plugin and select in the "instal apps" area, the app would be invok and use the well defin interfac to updat the menu bar, toolbar, console, etc with it app specif data and then render itself in the main "render window".typ these app would not be graphic intens thing and would updat more at an event base or user-input updat rate and not anyth that would need to achiev a certain fps to be usable. is electron a good idea for this or even possible? is anyon experienc in anyth remot like this and could recommend mayb a differ option? qt maybe?our dev experi is more embed app c/c++ develop focus so we are not super familiar with web base technolog and are investig options.thank for ani input!
