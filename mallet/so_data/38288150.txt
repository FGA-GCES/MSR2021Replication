i'm tri to understand the transit from web app in nodej with express to make similar app on the desktop with electronjs.th thing i can't understand is how you chang a view, for instanc in express if i have a basic crud app i have an thing control and view, and i can switch between them my click link render in the browser via express.how doe that work in electronjs? am i suppos to run express within election? is electron somehow the rout framework.. or do i have to drop that way of think all-togeth and use someth like angularj or reactjs?
