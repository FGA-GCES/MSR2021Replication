i'm a junior developer. i was task to build a desktop app in electron that would use reactj as frontend-framework.th app contain imag that can be manipul (cropped, drawn on,...) and then save a base64-str of the manipul imag into the redux state (and in firebas realtim database).th last featur i need to include, and this is where i'm hit a brick wall, is to make sure the user can select imag on screen and then drag and drop them out of the app into a web-environment. the problem is that i do not have the slightest clue where to start.i came across this: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/native-file-drag-drop which explain how to includ drag and drop an imag in the electron-specif main process, but sinc all my app logic is written in the react-application, i have no clue how to add this to the project.
