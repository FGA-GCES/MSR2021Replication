i have a coupl of site that i visit regularly. in fact, so much so, that i like to have a small electron app on my machin to check for updat (sinc the site doesn't support email updat or anyth of that nature). my script basic just launch a browser, retriev web content for the site, log it to a file, and then check for differences. it then notifi me of a difference, if there is one.th catch, though, is that while a given browser window is open (even if i close the individu tabs), i can go to these site and my session inform is transfer just fine without me have to login. however, if i close the browser window, then it requir me to login again (usual with some indic that my session time out).surprisingly, this behavior doe not happen if i navig to the site(s) on my mobil browser (firefox for android). that is, i can close and reopen the browser as mani time as i want, and i'll still be log in.it seem to me to be someth that isn't be correct persist in the cooki databas on my local machine. on my desktop, this happen with both chrome and mozilla firefox (i haven't tri other browsers, but i probabl could).so, my question is - is this someth i could chang by manipul the cooki in some way to make the applic not delet the cooki (or send the correct one to enabl the persist of login), or is this someth that can be control server-sid only?(bi the way, i'm not talk about close the browser window and reopen it some time later, i'm talk about close the browser window and immedi reopen it, so it seem unlik that the session would have expir on the server-side, unless the server is get some messag from the browser that the browser is be closed, which also seem unlikely).ed suspect i must be do someth incorrectly, becaus i just found out that chrome and firefox actual do preserv the session inform across browser closes. the problem was that, sinc i was log in from differ clients, it was invalid my session(s) server-sid apparently.so, i guess now my question is more along the line of "what am i do incorrect that caus the session data to not be correct store across electron app instantiations?mi configur for the }also, this appear to work just fine for a site like http://www.github.com, but not for an asp-bas site, which seem to be the thing all of the site that i want to work with (and can't) have in common.
