i'm new to electron and i want to make sure i understand the distinct between code that is appropri for the main process vs the render process. the app is essenti a react app host insid a singl electron page. so, as i understand it, i have one main process and one render process.if i want to make rest call as part of the react app (use axio for example), i assum i can do it insid the react code within the render process, right? no need to go to the main process for that is there?i also have to creat a socket connect to an outsid server. this is not an http rest interface, it a raw tcp/ip socket. can this also be done within the render process or do i need to go to the main for that?i tri put the socket call use node net librari and it seem to work okay. the veri first time i got some kind of connect error but subsequ tri seem to be working. that one error is make me wonder if use insid the render is a good idea though.
