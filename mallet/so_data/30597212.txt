i want to control the window size of an electron (atom-shell) windowbrows object from an extern program. i know within the electron app code i can use the windowbrowser.setsize(w, h) method, but i need event in a differ (non-electron) program to trigger this behavior. is there a good way to do this? if electron cannot do this, is there anoth desktop applic framework or method that could accommod this?currently, my hope is to set the windowbrows id in a file, then read that file from the extern program and send a command line string that tell the electron app to setsiz of the windowbrows referenc use it id. i am total new to electron, and i have no idea if this will work or how to do it.
