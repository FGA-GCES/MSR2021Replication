i want to use the npm packag lnk (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lnk) to creat some symlink to the profil fold insid my program folder. the idea is to copi some files, that need to be manipul by the app without admin rights, to the profil folder. the app itself should still treat those files, as if they were insid the program folder. is this possible?sinc i can't manipul the program folder without admin rights, i am tri to creat the link beforehand and then includ them into my app befor build it. doe produc symlink in the "links" folder. but sinc i am build insid a linux vm and use the program in windows, as soon as i copi the link over the vm, i have onli the folders. is there a way to creat link that i can copi over, so they end up in the asar package? i alreadi tri this by creat .lnk file in windows, but those link were not recogn by the app.or is there mayb a way to creat the link dure instal (becaus i have admin right dure instal and could creat symlink insid the program folder)?
