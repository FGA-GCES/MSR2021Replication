i'v creat an electronj app with pouchdb. the intent of this desktop app is to work within a wireless network of tablet applic that share the same data that is pretti much block from the internet 95% of the time (henc the pouchdb implementation). in order for the tablet applic to sync with the desktop app, they need to be awar of how to connect to the desktop app within the network. my initi thought would be to broadcast the ip address of the electron js app in order to share data within pouchdb, but i'm not sure if it possible. i am also think that i'll could instal couchdb as a separ instanc on the network, but would like to keep set up as simpl as possible. ani idea on how i can set this up with electron js and pouchdb?
