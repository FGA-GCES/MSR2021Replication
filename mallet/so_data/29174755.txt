i have this code:how can i make the header and footer stay fixed, alway visibl even when resiz and ifram take the remain space? a.i. i want the layout to stay fixed, with scrollbar show up onli for iframe.i think i tri everything, with as much googl as i could stomach, but noth has work to achiev this goal. either ifram is not fulli visible, it overflow over footer or the header or someth els goe wrong.so far i onli tri css solutions, becaus i refus to believ this is not possibl with css alone, but if there is realli no other way, js solut is ok too.i am do for a nw.js application, footer and header will be for window controls, so i need them to be visibl all the time.
