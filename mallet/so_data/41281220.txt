i'm think about an algorithm like this:1) get array of string from a json url2) pass the array of string into anoth file to add attribut to it3) call the second javascript file as a script in an html file to output iti'v been tri to write smaller program to accomplish this but the best i have gotten was either from step 1 to step 2 or step 2 to step 3 but never all three steps.first.jscan you guy give me tip on what i can do to my code to accomplish this or if i should chang my algorithm? i'm tri to transit to javascript from c++ but i'm not sure if my algorithm is complet wrong or not
