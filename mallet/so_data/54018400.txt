i am use a electron vue app with axio for my http call to my laravel server. everyth was perfect in dev mode of electron. but as soon as i build my electron app into a instal and put it on the client comput all chao broke out. i fix some issu but this one issu is gonna kill me. simpli put, even though all axio return success they throw an error that i put in .catch(). i'm honest veri confus how that is even possible. for instanc when my program load it make some call to get need information. throw error and display alert. i figur it was just my laravel server. but the data was success grab and ad to application. doe anyon know what is happening? edit - 1-14-2019after find the error "regeneratorruntim is not defined" i think this is a babel issue. i'v follow everyth https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill/ and i still get the "regeneratorruntim is not defined". is there anyth about babel + axio + electron + await/sync work all togeth with no errors? i person would like to not just ignor the "regeneratorruntim is not defined" and find a solid solut for this problem if possible. ani input or thing for me to research would be appreciated!
