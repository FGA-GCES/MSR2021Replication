the question is weird but it becaus i don't even have ani knowledg about this concept.her is the thing:i'm work with an electron app that is a whiteboard application.a user can draw someth onto the board and export it to pdf.this pdf will be save into a folder (i assum appdata folder on window or someth like that on macos), so that other machin can access (download) it.now i don't know how to allow other machin to download this file.norm we will need to share the folder (on windows), and other machin can go to networks/our-machin to find and download the share files.but the owner of this app said that we can download it if both machin are on the same lan, use some kind of url like 192.168.x.x:6554/mypdfile_somerandomid.pdf(thi url can then be turn into a qr code so that mobil devic can use camera to access the link quickly)i don't know how is this possible. can you pleas suggest some solutions?thank you veri much
