overviewin the snip below i get a paramet to the pickfolder() call defaultpath. pickfold is in the electron render process. it is do a remot call to utils.openfold (in the main process) with a callback (i have tri arrow callback as well as function callbacks).issuein the exampl below, i thought that direct bind the defaultpath to the callback function would make sure the valu would arriv in the callback. as you can see on the screen, the local context doe not have defaultpath, but the enclos closur does. but the real issu (as seen in the red text at the bottom in the console, is that defaultpath cannot be found, even though i am at that break-point).ani suggestions?
