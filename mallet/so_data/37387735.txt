i have made a so thread, in which i plan to describ my progress while solv the challeng about how to deploy the nw application.i have made good progress, and i believ that thread is now old for a new challeng that i have.in short, i have nw applic that host hapi.js, react.j and sequelize. i made an instal use innosetup. and that work like a charm.new challeng is as follows:if a user select a long instal directori such as: c:\users\username\appdata\local\programs\myappnamedepend on the user name, my instal cant be completed. if the "username" is short, such as "aa" then it will work, how ever have a full name will not, such as "john smith".on solut is to forc user to instal it on c:\myapplicationname, but client doe not like that idea. requir is to have it "installable" anywher on the system.i have identif sever node modules, that have over 4 level depth (node_module...\node_module...\node_module) and instal stop right there.how can i overcom this problem? doe anyon have informaiton regard nw and npm3 flat file system?
