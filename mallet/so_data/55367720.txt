i need to upload to a url a file notifi as a new addit to the folder i am watching. how do i do this without forms? i am write a basic file synchronis that use an electron desktop app as client, python server and aw endpoint. i am use presign url for upload/download request and have chokidar to watch the folder set up for sync.when i get notifi of add through chokidar, i make a call to my python server and get a presign url for upload. this part work fine.onc i get the url, i need to upload the file. i have no html compon associ with this oper (and do not want to add) i read that i can upload file use ajax with formdata but it requir "data" column. how do i fill this?i tri fs.readfil but it doe not work either. base on some so answers, i put the ajax call insid but even that did not work. i feel like i might be misunderstand this field.
