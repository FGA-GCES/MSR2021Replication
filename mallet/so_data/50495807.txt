hi i am new to angular and i am tri to develop a web app. as a part of my requirement, i need to captur the screenshot of the entir desktop, which i figur i will not be abl to do with the web base angular app sinc javascript doe not have the privileg to do so.later, i found that the desktop app, which is the electron allow the user to captur the screen entir sinc it is a desktop app. my question is that ,is there a way to switch between these two platforms?say, a user is work in the browser and he is tri to take a screenshot, he doe with the webapp that is develop with angular. piec of cake. now, say, if he want to test some other app which is in desktop, he need to open the desktop app (electron). my doubt here is there ani way i can switch between these platform ? ideally, my question is can the desktop app be open with a button click or event from the web app?
