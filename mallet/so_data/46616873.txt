i am creat a desktop applic that use spotifi oauth api. i am use the implicit grant flow describ here: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#implicit_grant_flowmi idea is to have an "authenticate" button, that you click and it open your browser. you login/approv the connect with spotify. then it send you to a redirect url.i want to set this redirect url to 127.0.0.1:58212 or some port on the loopback device.mi question is, should i use https for this?i am lean toward yes. one becaus the access token need to be secure, and i believ other user on the system could potenti read the messag when it is sent, and two becaus in the time it took the user to log in, someon could have taken over the port.so i want ssl for encrypt of the message, and i want to ensur i am actual talk to my app.how do i generat certif in this situation? i think each instanc of the applic need to have it own certificate, and i need to somehow inform the comput to trust that certif dure the lifetim of the application.i could also generat the certif dure installation, and do some step dure instal that make the system trust that certificate.am i think about this the correct way, or am i go about this all wrong?i am use electron and express in javascript to write my application.thank for ani advice.
