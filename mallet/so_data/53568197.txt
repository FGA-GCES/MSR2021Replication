this relat to electron-webpack.storag data (localstroage, indexeddb) is get delet on app restarts. meaning, if i complet stop the build, and start again. the data is maintain if the app simpli restart becaus of hmr or anyth els that doesn't stop the dev build.i have no idea how or where to start looking. i was not abl to reproduc this in electron-start that don't use electron-webpack. i was abl to reproduc it easili by use electron-webpack-quick-start and onli in dev mode. run the packag app doesn't face this problem. so i'm guess this must be relat to .i open this issu on github but it doesn't seem veri active.
