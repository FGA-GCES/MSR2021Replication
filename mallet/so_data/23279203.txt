efor this problem i am use node-webkit (node.js) and async, load a window app.th reason of this question is to definit answer: what realli mean asynchron execut in javascript and node.js.mi person code problem is at the end of the question. "the case". i am go to explain all about the problem i have direct with a schemat summary. (and i will be updat the info as you help me to understand it)th concept (theory)imagin a primari screen (js, html, css, ... node.j frameworks) and a background procedur (js execut everi 10 min, js intern checks, background databas optimization, ...).whatev you do in primari screen wont affect background execut (except some import cases), and background can chang even the screen if he need to (screen timers, info about onlin web status, ...)then the behaviour is like: thread 1: your action insid the app framework. thread 2: background app routinesani action as they finish give his output to screen, despit of the rest of the action in async parallelth interpret (for me)i think this is someth that "async" will handl without problems, as a parallel execution.even with this... jqueri doesnt work until the callback answer...
