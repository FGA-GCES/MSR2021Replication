i have a electron project that use ffi-napi to integr some cpp code and use electron-forg / electron-compil to packag the app.everyth work fine when i run "electron-forg start".mi javascript use xmlhttprequest to load in some binari data from a custom file format (*.awd). xmlhttprequest.responsetyp is "arraybuffer".th problem is, that onc i use "electron-forg package" and run the result app, the xmlhttprequest in my javascript no longer work as expected. it doe not throw a error, but the xmlhttprequest.result is much smaller than it should be, so the pars of the binari data fails.thi are the version of electron-forg / electron-compil that i am using:ani help on this would be veri much appreciated!
