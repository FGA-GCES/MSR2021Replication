i'm use electron to develop a software. i have a frameless window. i creat a titlebar myself use css code "-webkit-app-region: drag;", and i have a "maximize"/"unmaximize" button. the question is that, when i doubl click the title-bar, the window maximizes, but the "maximize"/"unmaximize" button doe not change. i'v tri to use ipc to communicate, but there still a problem. the problem is that after i click the maxim button, the window maximizes, but when i doubl click the "drag region", it trigger maxim signal of the window. as we know, a normal softwar should trigger unmaxim when i doubl click the "drag region".main.js:``
