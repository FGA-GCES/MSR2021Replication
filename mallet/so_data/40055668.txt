i am tri to setup my angular 2 applic to go to the default rout on page load regardless of the rout it on but i can't seem to get it working.i ad logic to my app-compon ngoninit to redirect to my home rout but it be ignored.for some context, i am creat a electron applic that has a linear user flow which is work fantast if the user start the applic on the default page. if i am on say page 3 and refresh, the entir applic state is all out of wack. i am not use a databas to retain state and i think store in local storag is too much of a burden for my end goal. cheers!
