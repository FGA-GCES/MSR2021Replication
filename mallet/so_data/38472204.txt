i'm build an electron app for window tablet for a client (surfac pro). the on-screen keyboard work wonder for most purposes, howev i have some use case where the user click "new" and i display a dialog with a default text input (such as name). in this scenario, i'd like to just pop up the on-screen keyboard if we'r in tablet mode rather than forc the user to click again on the name textbox. it seem that even if i focus the textbox, the keyboard will onli appear if the user tap on the text field.i there anyway in electron to trigger the on-screen keyboard behavior manually?
