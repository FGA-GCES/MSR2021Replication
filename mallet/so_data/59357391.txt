i'm use telnet-cli to connect to a light console. i'v got the connect to work fine, apart from i still get a cannot connect error although the connect still works, but i want to be abl to connect on the click of a button, but on load. obvious document isn't avail to use with nodej so i just need a way of call the connect function within javascript. i'm also use electron to make this into a desktop program and not a website. not sure if that'll chang anything. the function i need to call is connecttoconsole() which is at the bottom of the first lot of code.electron.jsani advic on how i should do this is, or anoth method of connect to the consol with telnet, is great appreciated!
