i am pretti fresh to the electron, and i am work on build an applic that use facebook/googl to author a user. everyth work fine when i am work on development, when i just use localhost:3000 as the callback url for facebook/googl api. but when i build the app and run it, thing just fell apart. i follow the step on this medium post here to configur the build proces. and to make it simpl i just use the npm submodule: react-facebook-login, react-google-login.i thought there should be ani differ between these two, but the process work fine on dev but not on built app:should i treat this case as a nativ app and rebuild the author from scratch instead of use node module?
