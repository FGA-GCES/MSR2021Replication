i'm tri to take an exist web applic written with angular and wrap it in electron. i'v gotten electron to open the angular app, but instead of the applic go out to a web service, i'd like for the electron wrapper to servic ajax requests. example, the angular app tri to fetch at "api/subscriptions", i'd like it to request from the electron side and then have electron serv data fetch from the local filesystem. is there a way to do that, or am i go to need to make a custom angular servic that is onli includ when build for the electron environment? i'd like to keep the angular app as environ non-specif as possible.
