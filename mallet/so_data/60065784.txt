i'm develop an applic use electron which i hope to sell. i hope to charg a year subscript fee for the software. i don't have ani experi develop this type of application, so after some research i hope you all can provid some feedback on whether my concept is sound. i don't think scale and number of concurr user will ever be a problem as i hope to have onli about 5 user the first year, then perhap add about 50 year a year for sever years. sinc onc i start it will be hard to chang some of these choices, i want to make sure i make the right decis from the start. here what i'm think for my development:a desktop applic which i will instal for each user. the applic function to gather and record data through desktop input (an internet connect will not be requir to use this portion of the program.)th app will be develop use electron.data will resid on a local mysql databas and consist of about 10 differ tables.th app will write about 1,000 line to one of the tabl at each use (mayb 50 time a year), while the rest of the tabl will be master data with between 5 and 50 rows, which will onli occasion change.aft each “use”, and when (eventually) connect to the internet, the data can synch to the cloud at the press of a “publish” button. (this is one aspect i'm clueless on. is this a good way non-connect applic eventu get the data to the cloud?)cloud design – the user will log into a websit to run report from the data gather and upload from the desktop application.i'm think of use microsoft azur and store the data in sql (type) databas – most becaus i like what i see for the potenti for eventu ai data analysi for my type of data.to creat the report i'll use serverless function written most in python.ani recommend will be great appreciated.thanks!mik
