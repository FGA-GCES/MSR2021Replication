my project is a medium size electron app, and i use promise-mysql to reach the back end. while there are sever good exampl cover how to connect to mysql in electron, none i have found are use a connect pool.th databas server i am use is veri small (a nuc), and so i wish to use a pool of connect to keep a lid on things. it seem to me that the natur place to instanti the connect pool would be in electron main.j file just befor the app launch the window. this is so that all the render can get to it. to get and releas connect i wrote ipc handler like this:however, this fails. the render do not receiv the promis from getconnection(), and i think i found out why. when event.sender.send (which is webcontents.send) pass the argument, the doc state: "argument will be serial in json intern and henc no function or prototyp chain will be included."so it appear the abil to .then() the getconnect promis in the render is strip away by json serialization.do anyon have ani solut to offer on implement the promise-mysql connect pool in electron so that ani render can call getconnect / releaseconnect on it? thank you.
