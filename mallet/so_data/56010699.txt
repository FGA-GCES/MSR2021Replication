i have a function that send a queri to ipcmain and then wait for the sql queri to be ran. when the respons come back i loop over the return data and display that on screen for the user to see. for some reason whenev the data is return and i log it from the render process it is sort alphabetically. i haven't been abl to determin where/whi this sort is occurring.it would seem to me base on console.log that sometim between ipcmain send the request and the render process receiv the data it is get sorted. ani insight would be apprciated.i'v log in all the blatant place to see if i can diagnos where the order is come from.
