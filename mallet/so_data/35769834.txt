i have a nw.js app that simpli (recursively) scan a directori tree and get the stat for each file/directory. it also perform a md5 for files.i have 29k files, 850 folders, all for 120gb data.aft almost 7 minutes, my code onli scan 4080 file over the 29k files.how is it possibl that it is so slow?? is there someth i can do to improv performance? otherwise, node would be useless to me...what is surprising, is that it took "only" 7 second to scan 1k files. whi is it 60 time longer to scan onli 4 time as much files?when i check the processes, i can see that node move a lot in ram usage: from 20mb to 400mb (it fluctuat both ways). but the cpu usag is stuck at 1%.it is weird, becaus i don't think i am alloc so much ram. actually, i don't alloc anything! pleas see my code below.
