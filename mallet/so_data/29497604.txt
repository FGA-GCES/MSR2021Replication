i would like to creat a node-webkit app but avoid redistribut the font files. i have thought of a few approaches. i am consid the model use by host font solut where a temporari url contain the font file is hosted. i have a way to encrypt the font file. you could convert the font to base64 assign it to a local variabl in a javascript librari with closure. the javascript file is compil to binari and cannot be read by the end user.set the base64 valu to a style properti would potenti expos the font as a base64 valu to the dom. what i would like to do is creat a temporari rout to the font file that i render from the privat base64 valu then remov the rout onc it is accessed. i can see how to achiev this as a node.j app but i'm new to node-webkit and don't see ani document on router.it seem like the host font solut allow a one-tim access to the font file so user cannot download the files. so doe node-webkit have the capabl to perform routing?
