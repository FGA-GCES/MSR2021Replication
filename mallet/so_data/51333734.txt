i'm work on a nw.js-base applic that use a document scanner. sinc the api for that scanner is pack in a ocx component, i had to build a wrapper dll in c++ and call this wrapper through the node-ffi module.th scanner api is event-based, so it fire event for almost everything. from hardwar initi to imag generat when process documents.th issu i'm face is when the scanner notifi my wrapper layer about the imag from the document be scanned. the api fire the event twice, one for the front imag and anoth for the rear image. when test the wrapper dll use a consol application, everyth work fine and i can get the two imag from the document. if i call the dll from node-ffi (through my nw.js application) the behavior is almost the same, except that i get onli the front imag from the document.i analyz the behavior of the two applic use windbg and i could notic that everyth seem to be the same between the two tests. the onli differ is that the event for imag generat is be fire onli onc when test from the nw.js application.it veri strang and i'm run out of idea about what to investigate. doe anyon here have face this kind of issue?ani idea and hint are welcome.thanks!
