i am test the usag of electron and serialport modulesâ€¦ when i run the i ran the rebuild command (node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild) and the 79 got downgrad to 50, and with it, my problem continues.i tri to chang my node version and rebuild, but the 50 still the same.th second node_module_vers (73) is base on electron version. i chang electron version, rebuilt and this version chang too.th first node_module_vers (79) is base on the build of serialport (i think).mi question are:what my first node_module_vers (79) build is base on?whi did it downgrad to 50 and not to ani other version? what tell to electron-rebuild which node_module_vers it should use? is this even the way it work or am i total lost?
