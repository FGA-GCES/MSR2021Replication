under normal circumstances, web app with inter-pag communic don't need to worri about cross-origin access if their page are serv from the same domain in the "http" protocol. electron seem to build applic use webpag over "file" protocol by default. this protocol doe not allow for ani inter-pag communication.if my electron applic need inter-pag communic (over an ifram in this case) am i right in think that the applic need to run a webserv alongsid electron? it seem excess and i haven't seen much talk about it, but i can't see ani better way around it. there is an electron api for custom protocols, but the doc don't show how to use custom protocols, just how to set them up and i haven't been abl to find ani good tutori on it.overall, i'v been impress with electronj as a framework and as a community, so i'm surpris that i'v not been abl to find a solut to this issu after some serious searching. i'v found the question ask a number of times, but no solid answers. i'd realli appreci some enlightenment.update:i see now that the particular of my situat (need to talk between a parent window and an iframe) make this a more tricki problem than if there were two separ window (such as a main window and set window) as the main process can usual act as a liason through ipc. this certain explain whi a solut has been so elusive.
