i am run a rest node js http server on localhost within in my electron app. i listen on port 0, so that the os give me a random free port. how can i access the givin port within my angular code to be abl to know on which url i have to perform xhttp requests?restapi server (nodejs) run on 127.0.0.1:0ani idea how i can replac the fix port 1337 with the port that i get when open the listen on the server side?or should i just use a fix port on both side and hope that it free? sound wrong to me.also i cant just go for /api/hero as url, becaus electron/angular is run on http://localhost:4200 (ng serve).
