i am develop an electron applic for a client and they need an easi way to updat the app as i work on it. i have found that the easiest way is to just includ support for pull from a git repo and this work fine in my test and on the client machine.recently, they tri to instal the app on a new mac that doe not have git installed. the client, who is not tech savvy, is have a lot of troubl instal git and it took me a while to walk them through download the installer, click on it, run it etc. to avoid this in the future, i'd like to just bundl git in my electron applic and use a local copy. is this possible/doable/desirable? are there ani other good way to approach this problem?
