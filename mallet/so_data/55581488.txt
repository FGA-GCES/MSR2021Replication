i'm creat an electron app where we want a nav look toolbar to be dock on the right side of the screen. it need to be on the right side becaus most of our user are on window and dock it on the left would mean it overlap lot of icon and it would be cover by the start menu. when the user click an icon, i need the window to open/res toward the left.on app launch i creat a new windowani idea how to do this? i understand that the width,height is be set from top left corner be 0,0. ani way to reset this?
