i'm have troubl use the npm sqlite3 packag with electron. i'm compil my electron app from typescript file to javascript, bundl them with browserify, and then run the main bundl to launch the main process.but when i tri to use sqlite3, i have problems. i'v tri use electron-rebuild as it own separ step befor compil the typescript. i'v tri instal sqlite3 with a --build-from-sourc flag. but whenev i tri to run my main bundle, i get a "package.json doe not exist" error, which seem to be come from node-pre-gyp code in my main bundle, which is from the sqlite3 module.do anyon have ani idea as to what i'm do wrong? i don't understand whi the code is build itself again with node-pre-gyp when i alreadi rebuilt it with electron-rebuild. i have a package.json in the root directori of the project, but the main bundl is in (root)/build/js-bundles, and the code is look for package.json in (root)/build.i know my descript isn't all that clear, so if anyth isn't obvious i'll do my best to clarify. (the program work fine when i remov the depend on sqlite3).
