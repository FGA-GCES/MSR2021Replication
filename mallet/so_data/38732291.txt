i have an electron application. i open a new electron window with a html-form to save some data in websql database.for this it a -button with a style-id. the action will be ad by jqueri click.&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;thi work fine. but on the same time, i'd like to close this "add entry"-window. becaus no more action is needed. my problem is, when i add also "window.close()" to javascript, the window will be close without save the data in websql.i think the close action is execut faster than websql write process.so how can i close the window after the data will be realli saved?
