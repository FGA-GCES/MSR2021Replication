i have develop a veri simpl electron app, which i then packag use "electron-packager".i zip up the applic and sent it to my client. when this client run the application, he get the "window protect your pc" window/warn with "window defend smartscreen prevent an unrecogn app from starting. run this app might put your pc at risk.app: appname.exepublisher: unknown publisheralong with the "run anyway" and "don't run" buttons.th app run fine when the user click on "run anyway", but understand he would like to get rid of this warn (and at the veri least show the actual publisher).i know about the code-sign certs, so there is no need to go there...(import note: i haven't ask him to look at the properti of the file to see if secur indic "this file came from anoth comput and might be block to help protect this computer.". i am go to check that tomorrow and hope it just need to be "unblocked".)what i am wonder is, whi don't i get this same warn when i run the applic on my pc? (we are both run window 10.) i have crank my uac all the way up to "alway notify" and i have tri set "check app and files" and "smartscreen for microsoft edge" to "warn" and even "block". still, the applic alway start with no error or warnings. if i could at least reproduc what he is seeing, i would at least know if/when the code-sign works.(to be clear, i'm not use an "installer". the client doesn't want one. and, as i said, this is a veri simpl application/utility. they want to be abl to copi the zip file, unzip the content and run the app..)ani help is much appreciated!
