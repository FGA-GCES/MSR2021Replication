i'm use electron, github desktop framework built use js and html 5. i need to check if filea is differ to fileb, and similar with 2 strings.thes file and string could be of equal size but be different. they could be small (2-3 bytes) or larg (2-3 megabytes).th natur of the app mean i'll need to check this everi half second or so (i have some leeway with the poll time).thi data is store in a local database, similar to sqlite. i have full control over what in this database. my initi thought is to creat and store an md5 hash of each file/str in the databas along with the mime type and size of the file/string. that way i can check for differ in size, then fallback to mime type if size is the same, and then md5 if size is the same.mi problem is the poll frequency. in a nutshell, i'm get the clipboard content and check that against a db, so the size, mime type and md5 hash will need to be calcul at each poll. mime type and size should be ok, but md5ing a 8mb imag might get slow.i there anoth method i should be awar of?thank
