i have an applic that is listen for incom data from an ipc render channel. here is my setup:contain that send data to angular app (mainwindow):everytim the ipc channel emit the data-from-contain event, the data is alway get receiv from my oninit call, but the data doesn't alway get set in my form! the pattern that i'v notic is typic that the data doe not prepopul the form when the angular app first launch insid the container, after the initi launch, everi subsequ time the app is launched, the data appears.i'v tri use ngzone, settimeout, and detectchang method to trigger chang detect so the angular app can detect the newli set formdata, but it not consist prepopul the form. ani suggest on how to fix this?
