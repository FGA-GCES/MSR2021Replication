i have an electron app run an angular web app within it. we need to show flash content. i previous had this work when my electron app was run in 64-bit mode on a 64-bit machine.i am now attempt to run electron as 32-bit mode on my 64-bit machine. i have the 32-bit flash player instal and am make sure i'm point to that version, but it is no longer working. i'm load a web page within an ifram and the ifram load the swf content. but i get this imag where the flash content should be displayed.us navigator.plugin in the chrome consol show that the plugin has been installed.
