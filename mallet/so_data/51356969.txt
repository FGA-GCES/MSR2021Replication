i am use the input with the directori attribut for folder upload that when i am use in chrome give me as a result an array of file and inform about them but when i am use the electron build with the same input it give me an object with onli the local path name and some addit stuff.thi is realli bad for me as i am tri to loop through the file in the folder and onli accept those that have certain exceptions.how can i achiev that with someth that is compat for both chrome and electron? i thought electron was base on chrome?i am use reactj on the frontend.thank you
