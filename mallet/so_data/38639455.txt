i have a nativ addon that use openssl librari on a unpack electron app.on a window 10 it work and on a window 7 it not work , i am receiv this:just in case it was a dll miss (it should not be as i was link the static library) i ad the openssl dll on the same level of the exe. what els may be caus this behaviour?editinstal openssl binari make it works, i thought the static link would take care of that so i wouldn't depend on extern dll'sedit 2everyth would be solv if i could pack the static librari and bundl it on the ".node" file. use depend walker on the .node file show me that it is requir the dll and what i need is for it to have the dll code on it.
