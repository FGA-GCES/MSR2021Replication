i'm develop a custom applic that might need to use a proprietari low-level library, i'm look into the electron platform to see if it has entri point for extens plugin that work as if they were nativ js objects.i'v tri use electron object).i'm explor the electron code base but i'v just start and hope that mayb someon more familiar with it could point me in the right direction, the ideal way would be for me to be abl to creat a share librari (be it link dynam or statically) and to be abl to use the new method on the js code that run as part of a web page rather than as part of node.
