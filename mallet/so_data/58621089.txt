on mojav i had electron builder set up with osslsigncod to creat window build work with an ev certificate. outlin heresinc 10.15/catalina this is no longer possibl as the build process use wine to creat the nsis instal package. wine is 32bit, support for which has been dropped.th new recommend build process is to use a docker contain to perform the build (essenti use linux). i am tri to creat a docker imag with osslsigncod without success so far, and am wonder if i will ever be abl to get the ev usb dongl visibl in a docker container.anyon have ani solut - other than build on windows!
