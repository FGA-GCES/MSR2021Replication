i am test an electron/react app use spectron, which use the webdriverio command api. i would like to test the attribut on some components, but i want to be sure i am test them onli after the compon has reloaded. the normal webdriverio wait command like , wait for some change, but i need to wait until a compon redraw has occurred. for exampl the compon will alreadi exist or will alreadi have some text befor it is redrawn. this mean ani test on the text will occur befor the redraw, and i won't be test the new text. is there a general way to wait for a redraw?
