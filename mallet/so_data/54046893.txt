my code look like the following: is a new browserwindow object that has been opened, and i can see the content within it. i suspect that this is some issu with the browserwindow content not be avail yet, but put this insid of a readi event doesn't seem to do anyth or even prevent it from fire at all.th length of the data (and pdf filesize) is alway 661 byte regardless of the browserwindow content. probabl the minimum pdf templat size or something.mi fallback strategi of use wkhtmltopdf instead is unviabl (some css3 featur are unavailable), so i have to make this work.
