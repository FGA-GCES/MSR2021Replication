i am tri to build a demo which is a node.j c++ plugin. in node.j i am get a bitmap, which is in argb format, and i need to pass that to html5 canvas. i am tri to find the most effici way to do this, becaus it pain slow.curr i do the following:i am pretti sure that there must be more optim way to do this. it is not a problem to somehow keep aliv the buffer in the addin, but i would like to at least avoid the byte-by-byt copi of the buffer to the imag data.i am also not sure whi if i tri to use the imagedata constructor that take uint8clampedarray as first paramet blow up. in such a case, i am just getting:v8::object::getalignedpointerfrominternalfield(). error:not a smithank
