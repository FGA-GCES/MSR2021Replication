i am have a strang issu with an angular 7.1.1 and electron 4.1.4 project.data flow:angular compon "report builder" collect report configur option from a formgroup and formcontrol valid form and send data to docx-templater.serviceus button trigger createreport() functionwhen submit option for a complet report, the createreport() function call dataservic fngetcompletecontrollist() which return proper configur json asynchronously.with a .then() function after the async data retrieval, the createreport() function combin the output directori which is part of the configur form and send both to the docx-templater.servic createcompletedocument() function. onc the promis is return it updat the ui.angular servic "docx-templater" createcompletedocu function pass the data and folder valu to the ipcrenderer.send for the electron "writecompletedocument" channel and return a promise.in my main.ts, i have an ipcmain.on for the "writecompletedocument" channel that pass the data to a write-docx function for process that data into a word document.problem:when the data get to my write-docx function it is miss a sub array of object that are essenti to the export process.i have verifi that the data is perfect in the chrome develop tool consol of electron at the moment just befor it send the data to the docx-templater.servic and just befor that servic send it to the ipcrender (mean my data servic and report builder function are work as designed). when i check the data in the main.t by save the data off to a json file it is miss the control sub array within the second object of the json only. the control sub array show up in the first object as expected.i will note that what is come out of the ipcmain function is a proper form json file so it has realli just exclud the "controls" sub array and is not truncat due to memori or buffer limit or anyth like that.i would have expect the ipcrender to pass a json exact as it is to the ipcmain.on function, but somehow it is trim part of the data. i have even tri strigifi the data befor send it to the render and then pars it on the other side but that did nothing.could this be an async thing? i am at a loss of where to go next to debug and find what idiot mistak i made in the process.also, i realiz that the abov data flow seem over complex for what i am doing, and that i can probabl do it easier, but it make sens (kinda) for the way the whole applic is structur so i am go to go with it if i can squash this bug.
