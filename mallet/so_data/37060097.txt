i work on an electron app and am wrangl bad tri to understand how to access file from the script run in my renderer. so i am tri to share the filesystem path, which main.j knows, with the script which render the ui.i use this exampl as a guideline:https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps/tree/master/helloworld-sharedobji can get it to work just fine as the exampl is written. however, index.html isn't where i need the path, but rather the in the script that render the ui, which are in a ~/js folder.however, if i move the code to a script, i get an error when i tri to that it "cannot resolv modul electron"i solv it, horribly, by leav the code in index.html and make "remote" a global variable. that can't be the right way to do it.what do i need to do in order to access the electron modul in my javascript code?`
