first time question poster but long time user.i'm current write an electron app that run on window and osx/macos. this app has a portion of it that mount network locat use smb protocol on window and smb, afp, nfs protocol on osx/macos. when you mount network locat through the maco ui (finder | go |connect to server) these mount end up in the /volum folder. mount go to the /volum folder has been the norm for mani version of osx/macos. the wrinkl recent introduc is that under sierra you no longer can mount to /volum programmat or through command line (terminal) without elev to creat your mount point ("mkdir") and mount ("mount"). this program has a use case where user frequent mount network share and they need to be in /volum becaus the most common use video edit packag look there by default. i'v tri some of the sudo relat packag (sudo, electron-sudo, sudo prompt) to elev my mount relat command on an as need basis. the client would prefer if i elev onc on startup of the app and then never ask again.so my question is: doe anyon have experi in elev a whole electron app on startup, complet with nativ osx/maco gui elev prompt (not termin elev prompt) or do you know how to bypass the need for elev when creat mount point (folders) under /volum and then mount there in sierra forward?thank in advance.
