i'm build a tray menu with dynam items, which i have done successfully. the onli problem is i cannot set dynam click event for each item. i'm use shellj to run commands. below is my code sample: my menu item are generat successfully, onli problem is with the click event it use the last valu of "file[index]['path']" let say the last [index] valu is [3] whenev there is a click event it use the valu of file[3]['path'], how do i bind the valu to the function so the click event use correct value(filepath) for that particular menu item clicked.
