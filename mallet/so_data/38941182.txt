i am tri to develop a desktop applic use electron. i am also use angularjs.th problem i am run into is that when i creat a custom directive, and load a templateurl, the view doesn't load and the consol say it doesn't exist. yes, the path is correct, i am sure of it.th problem is that the applic is alreadi run index.html, so it can't load the second file. needless to say, i am not experienc enough to solv this problem on my own.i know that electron use node on the backend, so i suppos set rout and/or set a path to my static file might resolv the problem, but i don't know how to do it.i have search the whole web for a solution, but i couldn't find a clear answer.
