i have a reactj app run with with electron. in the electron dev-tools, the error messag shown is transform by the sourc map automat by chrome run-time.now, what i want, is to get the transform error output so that i can send it to the server for analysis.i have tri to do some workaround with source-map, by manual send the javascript stack and then run it against the sourc map. but for some reason, it doesn't give me the actual line that the dev-tool is show me.i could also tri use sentri but it free onli for develop but not for an actual product.
