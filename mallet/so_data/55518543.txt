i'm use node serialport with nwjs, and i'v notic that if i open a serial port and navig to a new html page in my ui, ani subsequ attempt to use that serial port result in "resourc temporarili unavailable, cannot lock port" errors.thi can be replic with the bare minimum of code sinc i onli need to open a port and then navig for it to happen:howev i'd like a way to leav a port open between page and re-acquir it on the new page! i don't want anoth applic call dib on the releas port while i'm chang pages, and i don't want to have to close and re-open port all the time (i still want the port after all... just on a new page, now).i'v not found a mean to do this in the serialport document yet, or ani discuss about how to attempt this online, so ani suggest would be much appreciated! i feel like mayb i'm miss someth sinc when problem aren't discuss much, i find it tend to be becaus the solut is obvious to everyon -_-sinc my applic is the thing that open the port in the first place, and sinc as establish abov it still has a grip on the port, is there a way for me to re-acquir it onc i'v chang pages? appar just creat a new serialport instanc with the same path on the new page isn't good enough.fail that, is there a way to forc nwjs/serialport to drop all serial port it has a hold of whenev a page changes? at the veri least, i'd like to guarante that a port can't get perman "locked" becaus it somehow didn't close befor the page changed. this approach wouldn't solv my concern over have port be stolen while chang pages, but doe at least mitig scenario where the applic need to be restart in order to continu use a port it alreadi grabbed.
