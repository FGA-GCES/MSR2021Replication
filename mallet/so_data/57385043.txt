i need to use cucumb to implement bdd in a project. my team is use electron, so i'v decid to use cucumber-electron in order to run some tests. i'v obvious instal cucumb and cucumber-electron, and in some other threads, the common suggest was to instal cucumb globally, i have also done this.i'v ad the depend on the package.json file, however, when i tri to run a test with the command ./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-electron ./features/my_feature.feature:123 -i, i get the error that the modul couldn't be found.
