i inherit sourc code with no documentation. it meant to be a web applic to run in a browser. when i review the code, it appear to be bootstrap with electron. there is a and it open a desktop app with just the menu (no ui). i am new to electron and understand it a way to build desktop app use web technologies, but did the team that develop this project intend this app to be cross platform (run on web &amp; windows). if so, how can this be deploy to be a brows base application? or should i be think along the line of remov the electron code and make it a plain vanilla angular app?
