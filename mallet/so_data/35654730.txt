i'm have a hard time figur out how to approach file upload in atom electron. i would post code but i don't even know where to begin with this one. in a standard web app i would post from the client to the server, either via a standard postback or use an ajax request. i have some pretti cool solut for that. but in the case of electron, i'm not sure where or how to "post" the file back. i guess i just want to access the content of my file which i'd like to allow the user to upload. i will then process this use node-csv and insert each return row into the app nedb datastore.
