i am work on a project where my electron app interact with a physic devic use serial commands, via . the serial devic it need to interact with is a child of the render process, so send command will probabl be done over web worker messages. but i have no idea on how to make the worker wait for a specif respons from the device.(sinc this question is of a more general nature, i am unsur whether i should provid some code snippets. if this is to general, i can tri to write some pseudo code to make my problem more clear.)
