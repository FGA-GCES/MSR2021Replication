i'm develop a simpl node-webkit app which is similar to a product catalog. so i have lot of images, around 1500!! currently, i'm done with implement and use grunt(grunt-node-webkit-builder) for build .exe. after creat an exe file, i use iexpress to make nw.ex and helper dlls all-in one place. becaus some of user doesn't like when setup look messy. so i have two steps:mak a build with gruntaft the grunt build, use iexpress to make it one .exein both cases, all the imag are locat in the application(around ~250mb).mi problem start when the user click on the application. the time of open applic is around 30-40 seconds! i need to figur out how to decreas time!(btw, in development, it is super fast)i thought that may be if i get imag from extern path and cach them make the perform better. but i don't know or i have no idea how to get imag from extern path after use iexpress!! mayb there are better solut or workaround even imag are locat at intern path. could you suggest me how to solv this problem? thank in advance.
