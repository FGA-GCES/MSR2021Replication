i'm curious to know how can one manag applic set in an electron application? i have found some excel resourc here (where to store user set in electron (atom shell) application?, for example) and elsewher when it come to manag user set but couldn't find anyth relat to manag applic settings. to me, the differ between the two is that applic set could vari from environ to environ (dev/test/production) but would remain the same for all user of the application. they would contain thing like api endpoint etc. user set on the other hand would chang from user to user base on their prefer like window width/height etc.what i have done so far?i have found this excel packag call npm packag be use for that? or is there an altern to that packag specif for electron applications?
