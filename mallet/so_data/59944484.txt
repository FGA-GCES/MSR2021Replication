i'm creat a music player for desktop with quasar electron and so far, it can load local file (mp3, m4a, ogg, wav) but not flac. i tri use a simpl audio element with the src set to the full path and it work perfect for other file type except flac. i tri make a simpl html file with the same audio element with the same src, open it with chrome and even the flac file worked, but when it through quasar-electron, the flac file give the error messag "fail to load becaus no support sourc was found."i check the version of the chrome electron is use and it say 73.0.3683.121 so i'm guess flac should be support already.do anyon have ani ideas?
