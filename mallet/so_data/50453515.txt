i'm build a board game from es6 modul use electron 2 (for chromium 61+) and the esm shim on the server side of things. this is the first time i'v written isomorph javascript, let alon es6 modules; i intend to be abl to run game logic on the client in single-play mode, and on the server in network play mode. so far so good, i'm happi to report! and it satisfi to not reli on ani heavi transpilers.now, though, i have a problem: i intend to use type from immut js on the client as well as the server, and i onli know how to import them into the server code. until now, all the import statement in the isomorph code refer to other js modul in the app, not to depend from npm. a modul like the one below caus an "uncaught typeerror: fail to resolv modul specifi immutable'" runtim error in the client when the app loads:&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;in fact, i'm virtual certain that the import statement is fail becaus chromium can't resolv "immutable" to a js file. but how am i suppos to go about resolv it? and is there a way to resolv it that would work for ani node modul that is written to be isomorphic?
