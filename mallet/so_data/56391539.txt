i have been read few post about nodejs/electron and i am awar that electron is a client side app. howev i would need to start a nodej server automaticly, without have to run "npm run start &amp;&amp; node server.js".for instanc in the "main.ts" file, could i just run a spawn or an exec, such as in this way, by launch the built-in .ex file (which will be generat by electron), it would also launch my api server. otherwise, i would have to launch the .ex main electron process and then open a command line and run node... or eventu creat a "launch.bat" which would launch node et the electron .exe.how could i start both of the process (nodej api and the electron app) onli by start electron .ex file?hop i was clear there.thank in advance.
