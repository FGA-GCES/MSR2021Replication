i am research what way to go. i need to build a good structur approach, in a way a skeleton app so other develop can start code against it.requirements:- web applic (sql server)- desktop applic (sql lite)- authentication- same code base as much as possible- modular structure- continu deliveryso far i was use nw as a platform. as for the frameworks, i have experi with sails, and unfortun it turn out that sqlite will be a problem for the sails. sail use waterline, and i cant make it work with compil sqlite. i would love to use sails, as i have experi with it.now, i am look at nw and express. at least i know i can make it work with sqlite.rec i heard about the electron. and i have some question regard it.i it better approach to use it versus nw + some framework?in electron, do i also must use compil sqlite binaries? if the answer is no, then it seem sails.j is plausibl decisionwhat are the pitfal of the electron in the long run?ani insight is appreaciated.
