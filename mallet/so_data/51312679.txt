i am rather new to react and henc i am run into sever roadblock when tri to figur out how to implement someth in react. late i am write an applic that onli consist of a grid view and detail view and in order to navig i have been use prop and function to manipul the state of the root compon in the children, howev it got messi onc i restructur my code and hierarchi got deeper than one level. luckili i was abl to implement a component. assum that the user is abl to initi a long background process (actual a download) by press a button on that particular detail page. most like there won't be ani issu run this asynchron and let the download process occasion report the progress to updat a progress indic on the current page.what if the user goe back to the land page, open the detail page of anoth item, issu a download there and return to the first detail page? basic what i'd like to know is how may i write my code such that those download are run in the background while have access to the data even after navig around. especi when return to the first download, i'd like to have the progress indic be automat updat to the state/data that is avail in the background.
