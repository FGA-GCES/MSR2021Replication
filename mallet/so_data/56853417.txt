i'm new in nosql and more in nedb so mayb this is a noob question.from the doc (https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb#creatingloading-a-database): suppos i have 3 type of documents: user (document save user info), order (document save orders, i have a userid refer here) and log (document save error etc)should i creat a differ datastor for everi type? or is better to save everyth insid a singl datastor with a "type" fieldname? i'v read the collect in mongodb are the equival to tabl in rdbms, so i guess i should use 3 datastor in nedb but not sure what is the best approach.
