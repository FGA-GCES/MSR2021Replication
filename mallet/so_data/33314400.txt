(i am new to meteor and nodej environments)i would like to implement a meteor-bas webapp which need to read/write/brows file on the client local filesystem. i use the meteor packag to make the client side webapp a desktop app, with the hope of have the access right to read the filesystem (becaus if atom can do it, then whi not my app).mi problem so far is that i don't understand how i can use an api like nodej fs from a meteor client.edit: this question is for a client meteor app, connect to a remot meteor server.
