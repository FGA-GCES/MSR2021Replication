i am curent plan to rewrit a project of mine. i made in python and pyside. but :) i now realiz that i have to learn a framewrok like react.j and electron for this.th ui need to have 2 page one for some tableview and 2 smaller plot plots. and the second two larg plots. with some toggl button at the top of earch plot. well my question is how would i then serv the frontend from julia.i have play abit with blink and interact. but i cant place plotlyj plot in a layout like hbox/vbox then it throw stack overflow error. and when i use tabulator. and place a plot in earch tab it dossnent presver it width, it get all compress to the left.al that said i know i have alot to learn about the web frontend world. but i just need to find the right direction. so would rect.js, electron, julia. be a good choic ?and if so how would you serv the app from julia thank you!
