i'd like to insert/past a text in the current activ window and at the focuss element within there, which most like won't be the app itself (but could be). i alreadi check (close to) all clipboard packag / capabl and it doesn't appear it is possibl to initi a past event from there. other solut for insert text onli seem to be for within the app / most for insert into files.tri creat a keyboard even in the render process with js, but this would be limit to the renderer, and i think it should be in the main to even access anyth outsid the renderer.anyon know how to do this / confirm whether or not it even possible?
