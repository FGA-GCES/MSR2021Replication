i'm current test in nightmarej use differ viewport and agents. i'm autom visit to a site that has a lot of complex script and styles. i'm not abl to suffici duplic the agent and view in a separ test browser such that the site display the same content for me as it doe when i'm visit with nightmare. for this reason, i need to be abl to right-click element in nightmar electron window so that i can inspect specif element in the dom.th problem is that right-click is disabl in the electron window. i found this answer which describ ad code to the render process:note: this code would probabl need to be alter as mention in the referenc answer but where would i add such code when work with nightmare?th main script isn't the same as the electron render process script afaik. as for that sort of solution, this would probabl be a better one but how to invoke?
