in my electron app menu i am use the built-in zoomin/zoomout roles. (the menu code be use is past in at the end of this question.) i start the app, choos zoom-in, then close the app. when i start it again, it start at that alreadi zoom in setting.wher is it save this configuration? there is no hidden file be creat or modifi in the applic directory, or below. i wonder if it might be someth about my develop environment, so i built the linux package, and ran that, but the behaviour is the same.anoth question i'v had is where the chrome debugg save the breakpoint (and other debug configuration) between run of my electron app, and now i'm wonder if the zoom set is also a chrome thing? however, i'v check and it appear to be save these set per-application: if i set the zoom in the develop environment, it has not affect the zoom when i start the packag version.(to be clear, this is not a bug i'm tri to fix - in fact i'd class it as a featur - but i would like to understand what set file my electron app is reading/writing, beyond the one i am explicit creating.)
