current im tri to creat a electron app with angular. i found a github project to get a basic project run but my goal is build up a communic between the electron main.j and a angular service.usu without angular the communic between the main.j and the index.html is fair easi : basic a communic like thati it possibl to achiev a communic like that between a electron main.j and a angular service? i'v found an npm packag call "ngx-electron" which should do the trick but sad it not possibl for me to use a package(du to restrictions)
