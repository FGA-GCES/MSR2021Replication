my electron app has an applic menu which has "open recent" entri as submenu. the entri in this submenu give 10 most recent access documents. i popul this menu when the applic start and all work well. howev in order to qualifi for be "most recently" access documents, i'v to refresh this list from time to time and not just at the applic start. how can i achiev this?ther are two specif sub-quest to thiswhen can i updat this? i was look for some callback when theuser click on the top level menu entry, where i could run the codeto refresh this list. but i couldn't get that to work. the onlycallback the menuitem has is click and it doesn't seem to work ifit has a submenu defined. a workaround for this is invokingsetinterv and updat the menu entri at period times, say 1min. but if there a callback where i can do this, i will preferthat.how can i updat this? i creat a new menu use entri in the applic menu hierarchi (i'v save the refer to the applic menu when first time i creat it). but this doesn't work.
