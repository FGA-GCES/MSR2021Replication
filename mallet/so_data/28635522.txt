i'm current calcul the hash of file with hasher.j from the opensubtitles-cli node. i don't think this is an md5 hash, i believ it is a custom algorithm from opensubtitles.with hasher.js, to calcul the hash of a file by file path i'd use:(wher "file" is the file path)thi work for fulli download video file (and i think even for file that are at least 60-70% downloaded).if less then about 60% of the file is available, it alway get the same hash (although this is not the correct hash), and after the (probably) 60% it alway get the correct one.i there someth i'm missing, are there ani node-webkit, node.j or pure javascript implement that could alway calcul the hash correct for partial download files?or is this a normal limit of calcul hash from partial files? if so, whi doe it alway return the same 2 hash (the wrong one and the correct one)? how much of the file would it realli need to get the correct hash directly?
