i'm have problem do someth i thought was straight forward. read the valu of a input field and then write the valu to a text file. i got it to work but onli partial and inconsistently. what happen is, text a) get cut off (not all the data enter in the field is written to the file) and b) space get ad between each charact so the line end up look like this "t h i s is w h a t y o u r t e x t v a l u e" i'm guess this is an issu with text be chunk but never write all the chunk to the file and i can't explain the space issue, encod maybe? anyway here my code:
