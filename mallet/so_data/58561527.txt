i would like to ask whether it is possibl to record specif applic sound in electron. i know that i can record specif audio devic sound or get the whole system sound but that is not good enough for me becaus i have to build an applic that work like skype (voic call + screen record + system sound recording). for exampl i have to record screen and system sound to anoth user and the problem is that the other user can hear himself. how can i mask his voic or select an applic from which the sound will be recorded?
