i am build a small alway on the top browser with electron. to show the websit i am use .now my idea is to integr an adblock (prefer ublock origin) into the browser and it should work and affect the webview. as electron is run on chrome (as far as i know) there must be a way this is possibl right?so after googl a bit, i found this:https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window#browserwindowaddextensionpaththi somehow look like what i want to achieve. i download the sourc of ublock origin an ad it to an extra extens folder into the project. i ran this function both on the browserwindow and also my creat mainwindow and both give error or not the expect result (which mean not block ads).so am i do this right? what do i need to change? is there an easier way? is there even a way?
