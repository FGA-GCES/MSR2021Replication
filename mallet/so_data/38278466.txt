i want to use fluent-ffmpeg modul to call ffmpeg with complex filter from electron but have no success. the error [avfiltergraph @ 0xb8.......] no such filter " error init complex filter . invalid argument is the same as in this question error : run ffmpeg command in android ,split command in array not work but the context is different.what is needed?run this ffmpeg command use fluent-ffmpeg: ffmpeg -i safework-background-0.mp4 -i image1.png -i image2.png -i image3.png -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay=1:1:enable='between(t,5,8.5) [tmp]; [tmp][2:v] overlay=1:1:enable='between(t,8.5,12) [tmp]; [tmp][3:v] overlay=1:1:enable='between(t,12,15)'" test-video-safework3.mp4it use a complex filter to overlay three imag on a video in sequenc and export a new video.what doesn't work?obvi fluent-ffmpeg choke with requir quot for complex filter, that is my conclus (and is the same as for the android variant question above).what work without fluent-ffmpeg in electron?a you can guess i have to resort to call ffmpeg directly. to help others, the follow command, with input and output video filenam parametrized, translat to electron as:th abov command alreadi has remov space between various filter (in complex filter) for each imag or it would also choke.i would realli love to use fluent-ffmpeg in electron, not just for the conveni of call ffmpeg more eleg but also for some addit featur like easi progress reporting.
