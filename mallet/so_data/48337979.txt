context menu on some platforms, the draggabl area will be treat as a non-client frame, so when you right click on it a system menu will pop up. to make the context menu behav correct on all platform you should never use a custom context menu on draggabl areas.taken from https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/frameless-window.mdi there a way to work around this. i need to have an imag dragabl and abl to handl both click and right click events. (much like facebook messeng on mobil devices).it set an element as dragabl (-webkit-app-region: drag;) and use context menu event work as expect in mac but when use the build on window it doesn't work.
