we build an electron app which use electron-build to make a nsis installer. everyth work fine except when the uninstal is run in silent mode and the app is still running. the observ issu is that the app is not termin (as expected), and the instal is onli partial removed.th electron-build version is 19.48.3, which has a hardcod depend on nsis 3.0.1.13, and nsis-resourc 3.3.0.the document say the uninstal has to be run with an /s option, and ani messagebox has to have a /sd option to design a silent result, which is the case with the app.i there anyth els i am miss which control the behavior in this use case?thanks!
