i'm develop an electron app with nativ addon on mac, and the workflow of all the compon is like this:j in electron -> call addon.node(c++ nativ addon) ->call dylib use dlopen and dlsym.th addon get string from js by this way:yesterday we found a bug which is veri interesting. it happen when the string param is veri long, for a funcparam string with the size about 400 byte or even longer, the log in dylib show that the length of funcparam arriv is 0 while the funcnam sent in the same way is have correct length and content. after some debug i guess that the string might have been garbage-collect ,so i creat a string object to save the funcparam and then send the new pointer to dylib again, it worked!mi question is: how doe the js engin work so that the string resourc pointer is visit in js nativ addon while unavail in the dylib the nativ addon calls?
