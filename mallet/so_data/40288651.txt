i have been develop a browser autom applic in nwjs/node.j that use a data driven dsl of instructions.i decid to use the npm packag for chromedriv and selenium webdriv via the follow depend in my package.json:note: on mac you must provid a path the the actual execut insid the app packag ex: chromium.app/contents/macos/chromium'.so far i am use chromium not chrome and the version is still not correct, but i did verifi it was differ than what i am run without set the path. in theori i should be abl to run chrome the same way if i could reliabl freez the auto updat process while still packag the applic stand alone. i may just resort to use chromium if that doesn't work.
