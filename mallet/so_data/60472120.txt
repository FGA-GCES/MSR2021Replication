i'm attempt to creat a simpl javascript canva game in a desktop app use an electron. i'm use pixel art, so in order to keep my pixel art imag to stay in good qualiti as they scale, i am use the follow css:unfortunately, as the player control the main sprite to make it move left and right, a strang rippl effect shift a line through the sprite as it moves.example: https://imgur.com/a/mucjv4wif i onli use crisp-edges, this problem is fixed, but obvious a lot of qualiti is lost from the art.i there anyth i can do to prevent this effect and just keep each pixel in it correct place?
