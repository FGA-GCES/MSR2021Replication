i know that it is sound strange. the point is that i want a nodej app to control the browser. on the same time, i want to see the browser and be abl to interact with it it, and see what it is do in real-time.if it is not possibl in phantomjs, there is ani other way to control a dedic browser from nodejs. (dedic browser i mean that i don't want to use my own person chrome)usag case: for example, i want to test an app that requir "login". i don't want to test the login process. so i need to "login" manually, (let the browser to save the cookies), and then i will be abl to run the test use the same cooki of the log in user.in other words: is it possibl to interact with as browser that control by nodejs? i need the option to show the browser and hide it (so it will work from desktop and headless servers)
