i have an electron (4.0) app. i'm use the openid/appauth-j node module.thi modul bring up a nativ browser window when perform openid connect hybrid flows.(i am use identityserv 3 for the server)i want to use an electron browserwindow instead.th flow work up to the point where the consent screen is shown.th consent screen has a minifi version of jqueri (v1.11.0) follow by bootstrap (v3.0.3).the page display fine in nativ browser, but in electron i get the messag "bootstrap requir jquery"i'v tri set the browserwindow option nodeintegration:tru (i appreci this is overkill). i'v partial look at pre-load aswell, but i think this is undesir as the web servic could be use by other clients.i'v also tri --enable-sandbox togeth with sandbox: true, but this break the main window.i'v also tri debug the javascript code to identifi whi it fail to run correctly, but it complic due to the openid flow interaction.i requir the popup window to execut remot resourc javascript like a chrome or other mainstream browser.instead bootstrap fail to recognis jqueri is alreadi load
