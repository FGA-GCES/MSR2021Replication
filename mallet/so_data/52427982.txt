while tri to implement the fix for the datatables.net header size problem (header aren't size to the tabl bodi when creat in a hidden tab), i discov that my event listen function is never call when i run the page from within electron (2.0.9). when i run the same html page within a browser, the event listen runs. i'm use bootstrap v4.0.0, and the datatables.net-bs4 npm packag (version 1.10.19).here is the applic html page:thi get call when i click on the tab, and the valu are there for all but the fn.datat log lines. the console.log for fn.datatable.t show an empti array, and a _api object that appear to be empti of data.
