i'm current write an app with electron, create-react-app, and node.j (note: in electron, websecur is disabl to make cor requests).in my app.j file i'm tri to write a modul to test proxi by send a request to a site and check the response, like soand i test it with both a work and non-work proxi and got the correct responses.mi question is whi is create-react-app caus the request to not be rout through the proxy? is it due to the fact that it be host on https://localhost:3000 or is it actual an electron base issue?
