i'm write an electron app for tracking. i'm use here map (js api) and basic map and place of marker work great. the problem is that the storecont method for download map so they can be access if an internet connect is lost give an error (h.map store is not supported). my code is almost ident to an exampl that work fine in chrome.ani suggest on whi it work fine under chrome but not electron? or more importantly, what need to be done to make it work with electron?i need it to work offlin as the thing i'm track can lead me into dead zone (i'm use a mobil hotspot for connectivity).
