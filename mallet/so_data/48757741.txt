when i unmaxim my window of my app build use electron (if you don't know what it is, just think of chrome in it place) my mous stay outsid the window and the button still has a chang background color until my mous re-ent the window. basic until my mous re-ent the window it think i'm still hover on the button. how can i fix this? i tri focus the window when i click the button, but it didn't help with the problem. this isn't a major bug, but it annoy my ocd. i'v notic other electron app like discord and slack have this too, so it might be unfixable.
