is there a way to configur the electron browser that is within cypress, by direct modifi the electron browser configuration?namely, there an issu with cypress where it cannot detect download prompts. however, there a solut that could hypothet be appli to electron, which would fix this issu with cypress. my thought was to go direct to wherev electron is be run from within the cypress librari after instal it via npm. however, i cannot find anyth pertain to electron in my node_modules/, even though cypress github repositori has mention of electron in it code.
