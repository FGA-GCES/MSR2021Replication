i am develop a nodej application. it will be deploy with electron. this is good becaus all i will need to do is to packag my applic in an app folder insid the electron package, then rebrand it as describ on the offici electron documentation, and i will be readi to instal it on ani computer.in particular, deploy with electron mean that i don't need to have nodej instal on my user computer, becaus the electron packag is itself a nodej interpret so it is go to run out of the box complet on it own.now, when i instal nodej on my system i also got npm instal along with it. which mean that whenev i need to instal a package, i can just use it from command line.now, the program i need to deploy will keep a repositori sync and updat by pull it from github when needed. i found a wonder nodej bind for git, nodegit, that work on it own without ani need of instal anyth on the target computer, which is good becaus i am not sure my user will have git installed. now, everi time i pull my repositori i will also need to do some from an electron app deploy somewher on an user environ that i can't assum to have anyth els installed, npm in particular.
