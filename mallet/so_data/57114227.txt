i'm set a player that work in the background, the problem is that i'm use node-key-send and it work when the app it be use i can use the key play/pause, next track, previous track, etc. but when i use the key play/paus for example, it send the "spacebar" to the app i'm use for exampl firefox.i alreadi tri some thing like ctrl+q that it exit the app, in the background no problem, and i put to make log when i use the play/paus button and it print it. so the problem it that the command isn't focus to be work onli in the player.i just want to make it work no matter which applic i'm using, or is it on the background or no.
