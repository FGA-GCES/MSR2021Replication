i have made a custom wamp server the code of nodewebkit just trigger processes/work to launch the apach server which is work realli fine. i had to run some cronjob on pc the cronjob data come from server when the app first starts. normal my cronjob are run proper but after sometim the cronjob just start and never finish and i have to restart the app. and then again for few day it keep running.i thought it has someth todo with log file when it becom bigger than certain size it stop working. but i confirm that it has noth todo with log file. i am pretti sure it has someth todo with my algorithm or chromium. but not sure on that.
