i'm tri to increas the so_rcvbuf of a datagram socket in order to run a high-bandwidth udp stream. with the default set i am drop packet even when do no processing. look around this seem to be an issu relat to the default buffer size when creat socket in windows. i don't seem to have an issu with packet drop in linux so i am fair certain it is the buffer size problem.th issu is that the nativ node.j dgram class doe not expos setsockopt for the socket so i can't chang so_rcvbuf. i have found a potenti solut through node-ffi, as outlin in this response, howev when i tri to load the ffi librari i get a win32 error regard the dll. from my understanding, enter null as the librari name should just load the current process, where node.j is residing. is this correct? the default exampl from ffi is below but give the same win32 error 127 result. should i be point it at a differ dll, perhap libuv?if it help i am run window 10, and the code is run on a node child process fork from the electron main process.node: 7.9.0electron 1.7.4
