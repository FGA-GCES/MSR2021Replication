i am build an electron js desktop app, that has offlin capabilities. it track data local in a sqllite databas &amp; synchron the same with the central databas server as &amp; when network is avail through the use of an api service. the requir is to authent the user onli onc on the desktop client with the api servic and keep use the token to sync data. even if the desktop app is close and reopen again and if network is available, it should not prompt for login cred again and should continu use the exist token. what is the best approach for authent in this case? how do we save this token local on the desktop client in a secur way ? also, the user need to be authent to the api servic use window authentication. (the same credenti that he will use to login into the app as well as his machine, i.e; the api servic and all the user use the desktop client will be on the same network domain) thank in advance.
