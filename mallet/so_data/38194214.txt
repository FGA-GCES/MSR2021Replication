i'v been do some research: you can't build ppa from a node.j application.apparently, this is not a rule, sinc there are a few project that have success achiev this. webudp8 is an example; they build the ppa for atom ide (use electron) &amp; popcorn time (use node-webkit)i did what ani human be would do: bother these guys, sinc there no document (or at least, none that i found).their answer: launchpad ppas don't support nodej yet becaus they don't allow fetch extern resources. so the popcorn time ppa use to be a simpl instal that automat download popcorn time from it servers. but, as far as i'm awar of, i'm not use extern resources. it not like i am download depend from the package.json. they are all --save in the folder to build.how can i make a ppa of my electron app? doe the softwar center work with ppa as well, or onli .deb's?
