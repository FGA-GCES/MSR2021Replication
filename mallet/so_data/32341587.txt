i need to emb a standard webapp insid a window app container.th contain just need to be a wrapper around a webkit or similar render engin (i would like to avoid use ie render engin if possible) and it would contain some minim window manag logic - thing like be borderless with no titlebars, be abl to fix posit and size, and custom overlay/always-on-top rule base on current focus window.i'v been look at node-webkit and it seem to fit the bill as far as contain a webapp is concerned, but i'm not sure i would be abl to do the latter.can this be done with node-webkit, is there some other approach that would fit my use case better? i have absolut no idea how window app develop is done, so i would appreci some help.
