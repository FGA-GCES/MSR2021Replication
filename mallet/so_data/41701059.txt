i'm tri to see if i understand how electron implement of node.j is done and how it interact with the app. from my understanding, the startup web page has a javascript file that run as a "renderer" process. code in this script can also access ani of the node.j apis. to creat new browser windows, code in render script use new browserwindow to creat new window and each window in turn has it own render script.cod in the render script run under node.j and as such ani code written in these script cannot communic with script code in the browser web page.i all of this true or am i wrong on something?
