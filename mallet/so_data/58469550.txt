i am tri to chang the style of a div tag dynam when the electron window is maximized. in the code below i want the div class=res to display: none when the electron window is maximized.in the electron api there is a .ismaximized() function call on the window variable. i am requir the electron remot with: const remot = window.require('electron').remote. then i remote.getcurrentwindow().th issu is i can't thing of a way to trigger a way to listen if the window is maximized? i could use like a useeffect() react hook that check window.ismaximized() everi 1 second or so, but doesn't seem veri optim and a wast of resources.i there a better way to check this? i need a way to watch for when the window becom maximized.
