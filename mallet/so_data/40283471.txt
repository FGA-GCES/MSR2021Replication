we are use electron framework. i believ we need to keep the main process non block at all times, if i run the slightest of heavi oper in it the render process get unresponsive. to counter it we are think of keep onli window code in the main process and fork a process out with the main busi logic in it. that main process would accept request from the render context and use the fork process to do the code. this way the ui of the app would never feel non-responsive. is there a better way around this. this approach seem to be an abus of the divis of labor gain by fork.
