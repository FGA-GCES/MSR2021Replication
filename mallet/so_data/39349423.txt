i develop an electron applic few week ago with the framework angularj (use to make the client side). today, i would like to convert this desktop applic to a classic web app. the actual client-serv communic is made with electron ipc channels. but it has to be replac by someth else. however, i don't realli know what is the best way to replac them for the communic between my new node.j server and the html page (the same ones, alway made with angularjs).i think there is a way to creat new ipcmain and ipcrender modul to adapt them to the communic between a server and a client. but my skill in javascript are not good enought to do it. doe someon know how to make this adaptation, or mayb have a better idea ?thank
