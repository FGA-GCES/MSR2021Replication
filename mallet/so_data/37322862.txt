is there a way to check if an electron app is launch with the admin rights?i onli found electron-sudo lib to execut command with admin privileges. but i have multipl command to execut and i do not want to prompt the user everi time.so how can i check if the app is start with admin privileg use electron ? the best thing would be just to execut a command insid the softwar ex: .isadminprivilegesus (can be a script that is execut on windows) that return true or false, and if fals :i will prompt the user that he has to restart the softwar with admin right and close it
