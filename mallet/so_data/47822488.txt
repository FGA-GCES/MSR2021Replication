quick disclaimer: i'm onli veri vagu familiar with html and javascript; i never do ani web development. i'm learn electron becaus it seem like a novel approach to gui programming.i'm learn how to use electron while also simultan learn differ javascript librari such as jqueri and bootstrap. i'm current work on jqueri via w3schools. in the exampl on the link page they use anonym function to write their script. cool, but i want to use the arrow function syntax.now, i don't know much about their interact browser environment, but i set up the same exampl in my own environment. the differ are that i'm use electron to display the page, and i'm link a script instead of write it in , and it work complet fine. is there some extra step i need to do when referenc a script that use es6 standard? or is there someth weird go on with electron?
