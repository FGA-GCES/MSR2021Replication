i have an electron app, publish on the mac appstore, and sandboxed.i'm tri to add a new featur that will encode/decod video on the fli so i can stream more video format in an electron context.i'm use fluent-ffmpeg and a static exec of ffmpeg.everyth work awesomely, i'v upload the sandbox app to apple, and got reject becaus ffmpeg is use by default a secur transport protocol which is use non-publ api, this is what they'v sent me with the rejection: your app use or refer the follow non-publ api(s): /system/library/frameworks/security.framework/versions/a/secur : secidentitycreatealright, after much investigation, it appear that i have to compil ffmpeg myself with a it, becaus it quarantin and block in sandbox).th onli thing i'v notic that seem odd is that my custom compil is onli 20mo or so, when the static instal i'v download is 43mo.i'm realli stuck with this.
