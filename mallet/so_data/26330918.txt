i want to set auto-upd up for my app befor i release. i'm a bud programmer, so when i look into node-webkit-updat i was pretti confused. it seem under-docu to me. can someon explain the overal updat mechan that it help implement?a an altern to node-webkit-updater, i was think of creat my own updat system. i kinda like how appl handl extens updat and i was think about replic it. this would involv put a json/xml manifest file on amazon s3 along with the latest version of the app for all platforms. the app check the file at startup and replac itself with the new version.i the latter sound plausible? am i better off go with node-webkit-updater? if so, can someon explain it to me please? my app is a mac + window project.
