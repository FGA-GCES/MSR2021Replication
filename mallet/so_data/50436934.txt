electron-build version: 20.9.2target: windows/portablei'm build a portabl app with electron-build and use socket.io to keep a real-tim connect with a backend servic but i have an issu with the firewall. becaus this is a portabl app everytim the app is open it look that it is extract in the temporari folder, which will generat a new folder (so the path to the app will be different) in everi run which will make the firewal think that this is anoth app ask for the connect permissions. how can i chang the extract path when i run the app?(thi is the screen that i get everi time i run the app)thi is my socket.io configurationani idea about how at least i could specifi an extract path or make this extract it the execut folder? btw i alreadi creat an issu about this in the electron-build repo
