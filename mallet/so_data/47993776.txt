i'v read ton of tutorials, but i must admit that this test stuff is still veri confus to me. i have a nw.js app which (of course) use nodej and also angular. i'v instal the jasmin test framework global via npm and wrote an exampl test which start with the follow lines, and place it in the spec sub-directory: tag, but i don't have this possibility. i also know that i could write a html file, which show the jasmin result page after test have finished, but i would prefer to start jasmin on the cmd line.first i thought about ad the angular librari to the "helpers" entri in jasmine.json. but it didn't work. the document of this file is unfortun veri poor. in the angular document and tutori it is alway mention to use karma. but my understand is that karma is onli use for test with browsers, sinc it spawn an own webserver. this doe not make sens in my case.would be great if somebodi could give me a hint, thanks!
