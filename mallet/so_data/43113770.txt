apolog if this has been ask elsewher - i couldn't find it.b the develop of a web applic (pwa), i'd like to offer an electron build for mac user sinc safari doe not support some advanc featur like servic workers, yet.i'm not veri familiar with mac peculiar (i'm rather a linux &amp; window user), so i'm not sure what i need to take care of when releas a download program. i'm not so interest in the app store (which need some addit steps) - i guess it would be enough if my user could simpli download an instal package, like the chrome team seem to do for it browser.do such packag need to be sign in some way or can i simpli creat an macos-electron-build and publish the result binari on my website, assum that mac user will know how to instal it?
