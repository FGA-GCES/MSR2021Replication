i'm new to pouchdb but want to use it in my recent project. the main concern is of cours security. i'd like to build a multiuser, desktop app (electron-based) that allow user to modifi document in the same pouch/couch db.becaus of some workflow some part of the same document should onli be chang by particular users. as i understand the onli way to do it in javascript/pouchdb app is to add permiss logic to client side js, and that dosen't sound secur at all. am i right? what is the real thread here? how easi it is to bypass client-sid js permiss and chang pouchdb document in an unauthor way?thank for clear that up
