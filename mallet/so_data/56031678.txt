i'm current creat an electron applic (frontend is in vue) which can trigger nativ drag-and-drop-operations. these oper behav strang if i trigger them with html5 drag event (like dragstart, dragstop, etc.). so i have to implement my own drag-and-drop handler use mouseup, mousedown and mousemove. so in simpl theory: if mousedown is trigger -> set flag if mouseup is trigger -> remov flag if mousemov and flag -> checkcurrentposit vs. initialposit -> do somethingfiddl if you check this example, open up your browser consol and play a littl bit around with the imag (click, drag and drop,...) you will see that if you drag the placehold image, the mousedown event is trigger and the flag is set. then i would expect that the mousemov event would be trigger frequently, but this is not happening. normal if you bind mousemov to some div it trigger frequent if you hover with your mous over it and you can get the actual posit for example. but this is not happen after mousedown.note: the mouseup event in the fiddl is not bound to window, so if you drop the element outsid of it area the mouseup event will not be trigger for the element. so the flag is not remov and then you can see the behaviour i would expect. the mousemov event is frequent triggered. so i think that the problem is that while the mous is press the mousemov event is not trigger correctly.
