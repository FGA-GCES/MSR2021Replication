been look all over for this information, closest i can see is the command line switches. i have a web page that i port to electron and im tri to overrid the browser inact timeout. for exampl run a report over 2 minut the browser time out the connection. my think for a quick fix was to wrap in electron and extend the browser timeout. https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#timeouthttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/chrome-command-line-switches.mdin electron the main.j look to have wrap the modul in webpack in all of the exampl ive found it look like this you can use app.commandline.appendswitch to append them in your app main script befor the readi event of the app modul is emitted:doesnt seem to work, ani hint would be appreciated.
