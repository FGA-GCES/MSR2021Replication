in mani applic i have a background page. such as with electron, browser extensions. we can imagin it as the redux store be in a webworker.i have compon that need to be updat when the store updates. these compon are not in the webworker, they are in various scope that i can onli send json string to. what is the recommend way to send updat to these components?i thought of do store.subscrib in the webworker, and then send json.stringifi of the store to all thing connected. but then on the recev end, how do i updat the store? there is no . if there was, this would still not be a good solution, as all refer changed, so it would trigger react to updat everything.
