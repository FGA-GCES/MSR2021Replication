so, i have a web app that generat larg buffer of color inform that i want to send to a node applic run on anoth machin in my local network. web socket doesn't seem to be fast enough for me. i was look to use udp and it seem webrtc is the onli way to do that from a browser. the caveat, it seems, is webrtc is onli peer to peer (browser to browser). i figured, i could use node webkit to emul be my other "peer". in my node app i could handl the "signaling" and have it set itself up in a rtcpeerconnect to my web app. therefore, i could send my data from my web app to my node app (local network). for some context, i have one comput run nativ softwar to drive a light fixtur and i want to use a web app to control the lights.to boil the question down, how can i make a rtcpeerconnect from a browser to a node webkit app?ani help would great appreciated.thank you!-jak
