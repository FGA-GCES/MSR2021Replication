i am creat ifram dynam and i want to prevent script that don't origin from the ifram origin. is this even possibl (via javascript/jquery)? for example, if my page load an ifram from script to be block and not run.i am use nw.js (former node-webkit), so i have full read-writ access to the ifram content as if they were same-origin.i'v tri use plugin (like those that bring cor in the picture, with whitelisting), but noth i'v tri is working.an ideal solut would also allow me to whitelist specif other origin in addit to the ifram origin.edit:her is my browser project i am tri to implement this in: https://github.com/ideasnevercease/ariesher is the section of code the ifram load is done in: https://github.com/ideasnevercease/aries/blob/master/app.nw/resources/scripts/aries.js#l376-l687
