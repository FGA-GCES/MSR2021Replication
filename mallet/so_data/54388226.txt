i'm tri to use typescript togeth with electron and robotjs.i'm a beginn with all of these technolog so i lack the deep understand of what is happen behind the scene so i cannot realli connect the dot on this issue.electron and my app are work fine, everyth compiles, but robotj won't work. the error i get is the following:i tri rebuild robotj for electron but it still doesn't work.i this a nativ node module? i'm not sure, gotta read up on it first to figur out what i have to do with it if it inde is.i this even achievable? thank and have a love day!le: it would appear that i was tri to use robotj that reli on node (main process) from angular (render process). when i move what i was tri to do with robotj from the angular compon to main.t that is ran by electron, it worked. i will tri and find a way to use it from angular, i guess inter-process communic or something, sinc i couldn't find ani other way for now. still wait for idea sinc i'm kind of in the dark right now.thanks!
