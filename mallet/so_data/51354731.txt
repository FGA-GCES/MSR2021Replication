the problem:i want to upload a file from an electron render process use axio but creat a formdata object use doesn't seem to work in the render process. however, if i use electron ipc to send the filenam to the main process (not shown in attach repo) all work as expected. i don't understand whi i can use some fs method in the render process but creat a formdata object use createreadstream doesn't work.th repo show this is at: https://github.com/marcolarosa/electron-fs-exampleth readm describ how to run the code and show output snippet with an explan of what is seen vs what is expected. but in short:if i exec electron with my app code, it all seem to work as expected. the file is process on the server by the restifi bodi parser plugin.if i exec electron with a main script that load the code - it doesn't. the file doesn't seem to get uploaded. it as if fs.createreadstream doesn't work in the render process even though other fs method do (not shown in this repo but they do work in the sourc repo that this came from).ani ideas? i'd just like to understand the behaviour.
