i'm a newbi to both web tech and electron! i'm tri to build a desktop app with mani window and field - includ lookup/search and retriev data from a db.i believ i have most of what i need to get the job done except how to handl the communic between windows. i.e. i need a dialog that display a tabl of custom where the user select a custom to return the data to the call window. so i pass the search string to the lookup dialog which display the custom list and in the dialog the user pick the custom and return the primari key to the call window (which will display the custom information). i have found sever way to do this on the web. but i can't imagin that i need to keep a list of all the window (about 90) and includ a listen for each in the main.j (main process) to allow communic between the windows. there must be a better way!! is there a simpl way to setup a univers routin to process communication????
