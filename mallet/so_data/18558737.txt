i am new to node.j and befor i go head first into take on a new technolog and migrat my c# base application, i want to make sure what i had in mind is possibl with node.j and if it is recommended.so pleas let me know your opinion!mi applic has the follow requirements:-tcp server (to receiv packet from tcp client such as smart phones, comput etc.) serial port access (to control a hardwar device)web server facil (to serv html5 page or provid web servic intefaces) simpl nativ app like gui for configuration.al of this need to be packag nice for end user to instal simply.whi i would want to do this you may ask?? the reason i am most interest in use node.j is due to the cross platform nature, includ the abil to instal on cheap singl board/embed computers. this is my thinking:-node.j - to provid the tcp server, serv html5 page and provid web servic interfaces. node-webkit - to provid the simpl nativ app like configur interface. i also believ that it provid the abil to packag my applic for simpl distribution, but i am not sure? (i could leav out node-webkit if there was anoth way to packag my app for simpl distribution. although it is prefer as even have to find the ip address of the comput so as to access a web browser interfac would be tricki for some of my users.)node-serialport - to provid the abil to communic with the hardwar device. the instruct will come from 1 of three sources. 1) tcp connect 2) html5 webpag initi 3) web servic initiated.
