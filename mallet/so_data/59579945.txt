i have found multipl question similar to this but none of the solut seem to be work for me. i am tri to use usb librari (https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) to access usb devices, and it work perfect as long as it was a command-lin test applic without electron. i instal electron on the ubuntu 14 comput i'm work with npm instal electron --save-dev and the test app provid by their websit work too, but when i add my usbtools.j modulein my understanding, this is caus by the fact that electron provid it workfram with a chromium-bas web browser which in turn doe not support the current build of node-usb. i have alreadi tri rebuild as suggested.ha anyon had this problem? i need to use electron, but i'm free to use anoth librari to access usb devices, as long as it allow me low level control (eg: choos interfac and endpoint, i cannot just send data over the serial line).edit 1:node version: 13.5.0npm version: 6.13.4usb librari version: 1.6.2 (latest, at the moment. npm fail to instal anyth befor 1.6.0)electron version: 7.1.7
