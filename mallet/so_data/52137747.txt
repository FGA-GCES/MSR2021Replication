okay, so this might seem like a weird question but hear me out. i want to know how to compil an electron app manual becaus what i am do is i am take the twitch app asar file and i hope to be abl to repackag them for usag on linux as it is cross-platform. i am want to do this #1 so i can use the launcher and #2 so i can post a guid for peopl to follow on how to do it themselves. i am just stuck on this bit becaus everyth point to someth like electron packag which requir that i have the sourc and the build enviroment.
