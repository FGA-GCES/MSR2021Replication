i'm quit new to electron, nodej and javascript but i'v been pick up thing steadili to nice results, but i'v run into a littl snag here, and have had no luck with search for a similar issue. i howev did find an exampl of someon use requir in the same way, make me believ that this should work just fine.in the electron quickstart, require('electron') is use for load the browserwindow class. so now i'm tri to do the same thing but in my class. i attempt to load the modul into a variabl of the class, then use it later in createwindow. this result in a "this.browserwindow is not a constructor" exception. if i send the modul from my main.js, which load the modul the exact same way as in the electron quickstart, over to my windowmanag direct as a parameter, it doe work. i could do that if there is no nicer way to do it, which i feel there is/should be.lastly, i am fair confid the modul doe get load in some way, shape or form, becaus tri to requir an invalid modul give me a "cannot find module" exception.so my question here is, whi do i get an except when i'd expect the same behavior as in the electron quickstart, and how to fix it correctly/elegantly.mi class:
