i have an preexist c++ static librari that i am port over to be compil as an addon for node.j / node-webkit. to build this addon i am run node-gyp / nw-gyp on a binding.gyp file i have created. this static librari is multiplatform, and compil for windows, mac, and linux via visualstudio, xcode and cmake, respectively. this static librari is alreadi use in a varieti of applic (read, it is like not go to be refactor just for this one case of addon compil - which is still in the proof of concept phase).al of the crossplatform c++ file have the .cpp file extension, even though some of them are actual compil on mac as objective-c++ (so as to leverag some cocoa niceties). in xcode on mac, i am abl to compil such .cpp file as objective-c++ by switch the type for the file from default - c++ sourc to objective-c++ sourc in the file inspector'. this is conveni as i am abl to have the self-sam file compil as c++ on windows/linux and obj-c++ on mac, regardless of the .cpp file extension. to build the addon, i am use the objectwrap paradigm. in order to wrap the objective-c++ class i must includ their .h files, which forc the objective-c++ scenario at the addon level.i am rather new to use node-gyp and nw-gyp. is there ani addit qualifi i can add to my binding.gyp file to explicit denot that a given .cpp file should actual be compil as objective-c++, similar to the type set in xcode i mention above? as an interim step while build out a proof of concept, i am success abl to get .mm file to compil as objective-c++. howev as also allud to above, mani of these file are actual multiplatform and should compil as straight c++ on windows/linux onc i move my proof of concept onto the other platforms, and so i would much prefer they keep the .cpp file extension.
