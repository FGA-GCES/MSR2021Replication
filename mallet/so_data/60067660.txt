i'm work on a problem at the moment in which i need to authent a user of a desktop applic with a oauth solution.i know i could implement a solut where i redirect a browser on the authent server, ask for cred then redirect to the resourc to pull the data.but, if i didn't want to actual use an extern browser, is it possibl to mimic the browser flow use just js? in other word could i handl the redirect within javascript to final achiev the token and next the data.i haven't start the project just yet so this is kind of a feel out question to see if the abov is possible.just a small bit of info about the application. it an electron application. i have seen some exampl for electron onlin but these all use the extern browser to achiev this. i'm total new to this type of work so ani pointer in the right direct or help would be great.and as i'm new to this type of work, apolog if it is a dumb question thank for ani help
