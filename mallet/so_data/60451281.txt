we are write an app in typescript for the window platform use electron, nodej and angular with typescript. the app is run offlin most of the time and therefor it must save data to some kind of offlin database.th databas must support the following:it should be possibl to save imag (e.g. at bit stream)it must have some kind of light encryption, e.g. save as raw readabl json file is not an optionit must be fast!support around 100.000 record (approx 10-15 column each)th databas setup should be handl by the app - we do not want to manual instal a databas on the devic run the application.th entir databas should not be load into memoryso far we have tri lokij and rxdb with pouchdb/leveldown adapter. lokij was fast, but save the databas as raw readabl .json-fil and it also read the entir databas into memory. rxdb was veri slow and it took +10 second to load one record!which offlin databas could be use instead?
