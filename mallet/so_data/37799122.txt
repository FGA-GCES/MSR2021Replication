i am look to build an angular2 applic that can be run in 2 differ way - either within electron or via the cli.bas the under compon of the applic is a set of services. in the electron version of the applic these servic will be expos via a set of interact components, however, for the cli version they will be access use node.at the moment, i am in the research/poc phase - tri to confirm that this is possibl and 2 question have arisen:do angular support ani other platforms? it seem that the bootstrap method is onli applic for the browser.it seem that angular2 doe not support inject servic within servic unless they are both defin at the component/appl level (i.e. a servic doe not have an injector). i am not keen to add all my depend for all of my servic at the applic level - in fact this won't work as i need non singletons. has anyon develop a workaround for this?perhap angular2 isn't a good fit for this.
