when creat an electron desktop application, that perform basic authent for the user, we load up a browswerwindow, and load a login form. this form, when submitted, essenti perform a post to url to authent and author the user for more privileg information. if the authent was a success, the user session is set so that futur request in the browserwindow use the user authent session. however, i haven't seen a case where the session in the render process (browserwindow) can be store to the main process, so that if the main process need to make a request, it can use the same authent session. how can i allow the main process share the session and cooki that the render process use for ani request that it need to make?tl;dr: user success log in in the browserwindow in electron. how do i make request in the main process after the user is authenticated, with the same session as the session in the browserwindow?
