i current have a number of shini app that i'v develop that i'm look to deploy on differ platforms. i'm struggl with the problem of deploy a shini app (or some deriv of it) to an ipad that doe not have internet access. although it is possibl to creat a separ app for this purpose, most like with react-native, i'm tri to find a way to recycl as much code as possible.thus far, i'v explor use tool to run the shini app as an electron applic use r shini electron (https://github.com/dirkschumacher/r-shiny-electron). more background is provid here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arrbbvigvjc .i was success abl to use this tool to run my app with electron but i realiz that run electron on an ipad is not feasible. i was hope to salvag some js use in this electron process in a react nativ app but i haven't found a way to do that yet either.do anyon have some insight as to how i could convert the electron app to react-nat without start from scratch or at least use some of the shini code (prefer ui components) in a way that can be run on an ipad?
