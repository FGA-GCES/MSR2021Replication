so, i'll be work on an electron app that use angular2 as main front-end tool. my back end is run laravel with mysql and oauth2. there will also be an android app that communic with the back end. the app should be offlin first (1 sync a month worst case) but will be use on a daili basis. i'm look for a best practic to keep the data store with electron/angular2 and have a way to sync this with the back-end. i found some tool like pouchdb and localforag but they don't seem applic for me. should i look into creat a sync featur myself? or are there ani other option to consider?thank
