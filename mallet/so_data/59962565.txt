in our web page, we have a list of document and a button to open the document in the electron application. this button actual has the custom protocol href with the document id pass as parameter.thi electron app can onli be use when launch from the browser (use a custom protocol "my-custom-protocol://document-id-here"). depend on the paramet passed, we decid which document to open in the electron application.if the user tri to open the app direct (not use link in the browser), we just show a messag that this app can onli be use when launch from a browser and then just quit the app.now, if the user has not instal the applic on his machin and tri to open the custom protocol link form the browser then we prompt the user to instal the applic first and then again tri open the link. this is an exampl of basic deep link and is work fine.for the sake of better ux, we want to chang this behavior. so now when the user tri to open the custom link (which also includ the documentid as parameter) and the applic is not installed, we will prompt the user to instal the application. but onc the applic is installed, we would like to automat launch the applic with the correct paramet (documentid for whichev document the link was clicked.) so that the correct document will open when the app launch after instal (we want to implement defer deep linking).i'v seen this page but couldn't find enough inform to achiev this.
