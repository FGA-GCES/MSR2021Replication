i'm new to javascript/node.js/electron stack. i'm write an electron frontend to a c++ backend (a standalon executable), with zeromq as the ipc vehicl in-between. with languag capabl of threading, i'd creat a thread for poll multipl zmq sockets, but it seem that thread is not a thing for js client code. should i resort to child process instead? but while there are alreadi , have yet anoth process just for ipc seem a littl crazi to me.what would be the canon way to achiev what i do?
