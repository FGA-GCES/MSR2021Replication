well, i have quit a simpl task, which can't be realli hard.i have an app, which use the electron framework to use the applic on window and mac machines. i notic that i am abl to use ctrl+c/ctrl+v on window without ani problems, but i am not abl to use cmd+c/cmd+v on mac after i use the electron-packager.i found solut like this (cmd + c / cmd + v not working), but i have a custom menu and i don't want to defin and use the one in electron itself. so i found this (global acceler without menue, but the issu is still open and there seem to be no solution. solut like this (local-shortcut) are also not usable, as they don't get the select text (e.g. from a textbox) as a parameter.i think use cmd+c / cmd+v shouldn't be a real issue, sinc it is a common action in everi application, but i don't see a usabl solut at the moment.thi also effect all other shortcut like cmd+a to select everything.
