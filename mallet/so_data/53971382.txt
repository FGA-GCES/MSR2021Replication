i'm in the process of write an app in electron. the app requir there to be a pdf render in a frame that take up approxim 50% of the window. becaus of the somewhat restrict space, i would like a solut that allow me to render a pdf without ani frame, margin or control bar around it. in maco nativ apps, you have access to pdfview, which is a pdf render with noth around it. i'm tri to find the closest thing to this, but for node.js/electron.befor this get mark as duplicate, i'v read through a number of "render pdf in electron" post on here. all of them point toward a number of libraries, notabl "electron-pdf-window". the problem with the librari is that all it doe is wrap up "pdf.js". i'v look through pdf.js as well as the examples, but it also has the chrome-styl frame and controls.ar there ani libraries/implement of a pdf viewer for node.js/electron that provid a near-nat (macos) experience, in a "frameless" window? it need to have copy/past support, as well as support for trackpad gestures. additionally, it should be abl to support document of at least a hundr pages.sid question - are you abl to modifi the default chrome pdf viewer? (i.e remov the top "controls" bar, as well as trim down all the margins)? this seem like the fastest (most efficient) way to do it, but i'm not sure if it possible.
