i am develop a stand-alon writer app in js and node-webkit that should be abl to store the product local when offlin and sync with a user-bas cloud service, like dropbox. rigth now the write are save in an object and written local in a file.now, each user is alon on his writings, so there is no chanc that somebodi is edit at the same time, so i don't need to sync live from server to client. but i need the app to be flexibl with internet connect (design for peopl of the remote), so that mean that somebodi could start it offline, start editing, then get connection, then loos it again. and sometim not have internet for coupl of days, and keep editing. and all of this should sync when connect come and go.th trick is, sometim my user will edit on an other termin - other comput or, in the futur, mobil device, and all of this should sync somehow.i thought use dropbox datastore, but they can't handl an offlin start, so it loos all interest.right now, this is my logic : everi sheet has a last edit timestamp and a last editor id that everi version of my program generat on first start. so everi time you got the net back i download the full db from the net, and compar each sheet whith the object store locally. if they have the same id, that mean nobodi els has touch it, and the local version on this comput still stands. other wise, i need to face conflict resolution.mi question is a bit too larg : do you have ani hint or idea, or link on how to implement such a sync process, or how to make it more effici from my lead ?
