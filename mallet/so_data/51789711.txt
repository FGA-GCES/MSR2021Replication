so i'm build an app use the electron framework and tri to pass some data between a parent window and a child window as i open the child window on a click event from the parent. i'm use ipcmain and ipcrender to pass a messag from the parent render process, to the main process, to the child render process. i can track the data come to the main process howev it doesn't get sent to the final renderer. i'm not realli quit sure why, but my intuit is that it has someth to do with the coordin of event of open the child window from main vs send data via .webcontents.send() from main.relev code:send data from the parent to maini know that this question has been ask on here before, and i'v look at the other exampl but so far they haven't worked.
