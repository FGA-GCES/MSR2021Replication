i am write an electron app that first search for a given googl calendar event, and, if one isn't found, it then submit a new calendar event. if i forego the initi search, the submiss appear to work fine. in this case, the code look like: function is be called, but it never execut the callback.i'm not quit sure how to trace this problem back to the actual cause. it seem to be someth get hung up in multipl promis objects, or perhap a googl api client not be termin correct after execut it functionality.
