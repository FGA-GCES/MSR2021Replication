i'm investig use cef in a new desktop applic in which i want to render the ui with html5/js. however, i don't want the model to be a typic web applic that just render in an embed browser (i.e. fetch resourc from a remot server like a web page). basic i want to have a desktop app that come prepackag with all the html and script that are need to render the ui, and function entir offline. my question is: is cef capabl of do this more or less out of the box? or will i need to write a bunch of custom code for handl and render local resources, or embed a local web server? a simpl exampl would be build the ui button and output for a basic calcul app (although the plan applic is much more complex). how would i begin to approach this?i'm also look at electron as a possibl solution. it seem like it is more gear toward what i want to do (render a ui with web technolog but without necessarili be connect to anything). however, we have some legaci c++ librari that we need to integr and i believ this would be easier with cef than with electron.from look around, it seem that cef support appcach for so-cal "offlin apps". however, i'm leeri of use it becaus of the numer problem it has. also it seem like appcach is dying, so i'd rather not tie myself to that sink ship anyways. unfortun servic worker doesn't quit look readi for primetim either.
