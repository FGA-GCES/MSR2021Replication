we'd like to build a small special clone of the ill-fat popcorn-tim project, that is to say a node-webkit frontend for peerflix. the video we'd like to play are mkv file that have embed ass subtitl tracks, and we can't seem to get the embed subtitl to show up: while vlc nice show them, html5 video player in webkit-bas thing don't, not even in googl chrome (so it not a matter of chromium reduc codec support).now, i'm a bit out of our depth here, i don't realli know much about these things, but it seem to me the media engin underneath webkit just ignor the ass subtitl track here. is it becaus it ass? is it a matter of codec somehow? or is it, after all, a html5 thing? now, the html5 video "live standard" mention that "caption can be provided, either embed in the video stream or as extern file use the track element" - so the featur is at least planned, but i do realiz that implement is lacking. however, given that node-webkit use ffmpeg as the under engine, it seem strang to me that the subtitl are not pick up at all.could someon more knowledg pleas advis us the problem? also, is there anyth we could do about it? extract the subtitl beforehand is not an option, though i have been play with the idea of extract the subtitl on the fly, and feed that stream back to the player - i had some modest success with this, and it look like it could be done with some effort, but i'm realli out of my depth here, and the whole idea is pretti contriv anyway.however, i find it improb that nobodi has run into this problem before, henc this question: is there ani way to show embed (ass) subtitl track in a stream video in node-webkit?
