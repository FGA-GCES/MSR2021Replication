i'm build a desktop app use electron, which is basic javascript.in it, i'm send an imag to my rail api like this:, but i'v had to make the switch to turn my googl chrome extens into an electron app.updatei solv this problem for myself by upload my imag direct to s3 rather than to s3-via-rails. it not onli work but is faster than go via the app, which i now onli have to tell where to look to find the image. but see as my origin issu was not addressed, i'm leav this question and the bounti open. perhap someon will solv it, claim the bounty, and write up an answer that someon els will find use down the track.
