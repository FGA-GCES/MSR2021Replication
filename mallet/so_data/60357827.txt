i'm just learn electron, and i'm tri to open a file and display it in a new window. i click a button in the initi (root) window, which then open an "open file" dialog, from which i can get a file path. i would like to then open that file, creat a window, and pass the content of the file to the new window. my issu is in get the string with the file content into the callback function for when the window is ready; i that even possible? my main.j code:&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;i have read that you can just make a new attribut on the webcont object and then refer to it from the render process, but that doe not sound like the actual right thing to do. so, what should i do instead?ful code at https://gitlab.com/sjbrown8/osiri
