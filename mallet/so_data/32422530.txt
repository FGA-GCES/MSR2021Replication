ok, so i'm experi a bit with electron (former atom shell) and tri to see how this could work in a real app.now, given that the app is go to be commercial, i'll also have to think of some licens generat scheme.in the past, i'v work with fastspr for payment process (+ cocoafob for licens generation) and i'v late switch to paddl - which admit work veri smoothly, especi when use their sdks - on mac.so, i'm think how this whole thing good be done - given that, now, the applic won't just be an os x one, but a window one as well. and that i won't be have full control over the app, given that the app will be pretti much onli html/css/js.ani idea on how to approach this? has anyon done that successfully?
