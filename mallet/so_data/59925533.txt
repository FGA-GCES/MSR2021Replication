i'm build an electron-boilerplate-react app and i am have troubl use context and/or propsin the home window of the default boilerpl i'v place a component, but i can't seem to push prop down to it -- they aren't there when i'm in the debugg insid the component. i'v tri use a context to pass inform down into the compon in the window, but also to no avail.i think it has someth to do with the fact that there are no layer between the root and the window content -- it seem odd that the layer that i use to implement my structur are miss in the element view... i am newer then i would hope to react and electron -- but i'v learn new thing before!!within the root.j file i'v ad a messagesprovid (with a default value)
