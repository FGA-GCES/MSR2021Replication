i'm tri to use a requir direct in my js file attach to an html file. however, i am get a requir not defin error messag with that file. my understand is in newer version of electron after 5.0 that nodeintegr was disabl by default. however, even after enabl nodeintegr in web prefer i still am get the requir error message. my understand was this nodeintegr should solv that issue. whi am i still run into not defin issu with require? here the relev section of the main.j file.edit: i was miss a comma between preload and nodeintegration, so thank to the individu who point that out! however, i am still experienc the issue. still get "uncaught referenceerror: requir is not defined".second edit: here a minim reproduct of the issue. the requir function is undefin even when nodeintegr is set to overrid it. in the end i'm just tri to read from a local json file but everi instanc i can find to do so in a simplist manner when work with electron use a requir in some way, whether it is requir fs or requir the file. if the requir statement won't function at all i can't make either work.main.js:third, and last, edit: see answer below.
