i am work on an electron/react/redux app that use nedb for a local data store (though this problem is not realli about nedb i think). i can use ipcrenderer.send to make call to load the local data store but i am unclear on how to do this in the context of a redux action creator sinc the way i get the data back is via the ipcrenderer.on listener.an action creator that obvious doesn't work...
