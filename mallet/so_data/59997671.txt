i have wrote an electron app which simutan start client (a react site) and server (nodejs) when the app starts.th server serv as a pass-through control as my client cannot make direct api call due to cor issue.however, the server (nodej express) need to figur out an open port to use in runtime, how can it communiat back to client that which point it is using?i'v consid let server write to a file but it is not a good idea, as client code shouldn't access local files.anoth option i'v consid is to use local storage, but server cannot write to client local storag either.ani other recommendations?or if share is not possible, is there ani way to solv the find open port issue?
