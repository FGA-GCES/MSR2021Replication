i'm tri to creat an electron-bas application, and i'm prepar it for distribution. dure development, i'd like to serv my file use webpack hot reload server.i'v had this work for a while and i'm abl to perform hot reload just fine - if i modifi a *.tsx file, i can see the chang render in the app within a few seconds.however, if i tri to forc reload the applic (via the ctrl+r shortcut this now allow my applic to reload the same path as it was on previously.whil this is a signific step forward, it not exact what i want. i'm creat an editor, mean some of the navig path are dynam and depend on the document i have loaded. after perform a page reload, the redux state is reset, mean some of the path becom invalid and generat a 404 error if i was at that point befor perform the reload.i'd like to see if there a way i can get the applic to alway reset to the index page on reload.
