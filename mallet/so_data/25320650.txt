i want to build a websit avail check servic that would pass cloudflar browser check (aka "i'm under attack mode") that give a fals negat error with isup.m no matter if a websit is actual offlin or not. assum that there no direct connect to the websit as well.mayb cloudflar actual has some api to check if a websit behind it proxi is online? that would be perfect. if it doesn't mayb it could be done the hard way. i'm think about node-webkit. it a full-fledg web browser so theoret it should pass the browser check. but i never lay my hand on node-webkit so mayb i misunderstood. do you think it is possibl and rational?ani other idea maybe?
