i'm transfer a live audio stream between 2 electron window process use webrtc. there are no ice or stun servers, or anyth like that, the connect is establish manual through electron ipc communic (base on this code).note: from the technic point of view regard the audio stream themselves, this is veri similar (if not identical) to stream between 2 browser tab on the same domain, so this is primarili not a question regard electron itself, although electron ipc would be obvious substitut with a browser equivalent.th audio stream works, i can transmit audio from one window to anoth in real-time, as it is generated. that is, i can generat audio (web audio api) in window "a" and listen to it through an yet.
