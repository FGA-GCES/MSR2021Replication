i have a project that is design to be both an electron app and a chromebook app/extens and use webpack to creat build for each platform.i recent tri to add a new packag to he project and it work fine with creat an electron build, but when tri to creat the chromebook build (which use a webpack { target: “web” } i start get a seri of error that follow this pattern:to the app configuration. that becaus the error for fs goe away when i put it here, but make not differ if i put it in the lib configuration.thi also lead me to beliv that this is the render proecess on electron sinc that is the target, and not main, so i'm not sure whi it not work here.ani idea on how i can get this to build correct for chromebook? the packag itself https://github.com/schmich/instascan seem to be design to run in a browser, so i'd expect to be abl to build it.
