i recent creat a client side applic use electron which current run standalone. i would like it to have function where i can send a string to all of the electron applications, possibl by creat a nodej server to do this. the electron applic would then receiv this string and use it within whatev function i attach to it.thi is not the electron frontend communic with the backend. this is an extern nodej server communic with the electron backend. so it would be 1 main nodej applic run as a server and electron applic deploy on differ machines. is this actual possibl to achieve?ar there ani node packag which could allow this communic from the main server to the electron applications? ani document packag would be of great help so i can understand how it function befor integr it.i saw socket-io but that seem more web base client-server, unless i am interpret it wrong?ani help is appreciated, thanks!
