i'm have some troubl tri to run a python script within electron use the child_process module.i recent instal anaconda on my comput (osx 10.11.2) and creat this script:so it look like this script, when run within electron, can't find the panda librari (let me repeat that this doe not happen when run in the terminal, everyth work just fine there). i'm not use virtualenv as far as i'm aware.again within electron, i execut which python, return /usr/bin/python. if i execut which python in the terminal, though, it return /users/myusername/anaconda2/bin/python.i don't quit get whi electron seem to run a differ binari than the default one i run in the terminal. finally, in order to test this more easili as the real code is embed in a larger electron app, i creat a new electron project and ran exact the same code (the snippet i past above). surprisingly, everyth work just fine there. so, two differ electron app but appar run the same code: in one case it doesn't work (seem to run differ python binaries) and in the other it works.ani idea what could be go on here?mani thanks.
