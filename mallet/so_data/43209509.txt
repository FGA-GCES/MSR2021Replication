i have been play around with the file system drag and drop function of electron app and haven't had ani issu get everyth to work with local files. i have not come across anyth in the documentation, so i'd like to see if anyon know if this is possible. i'd like to use the drag-out featur in electron to drag a remot file outsid of the app and onto the file system. specif example:th program i am work on is a remot file manag tool - similar to dropbox. i'd like to drag the dom element repres the remot file to a finder (or window explorer) window and have electron download the file to that location.i am abl to get this to work as long as the file is store local follow the electron documentation. http://electron.atom.io/docs/all/#dragging-files-out-of-the-windowi can envis two possibl solutions:do electron have the abil to pass a downloaditem or a url to the startdrag event (as referenc in the link above)?i it possibl to listen for a drop even of some kind and get the local file system path of where my dom element was dropped? for example, /users/{proile}/desktop? i could use my exist download method to download the file to that specif path.ani thought on how i can accomplish my goal? thank so much for your time.
