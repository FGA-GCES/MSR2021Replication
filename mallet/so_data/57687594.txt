i want to add an eventlisten for a function of a nodej modul to an anchor tag in my index.html of my electron app. i'v been googl and search for solut here, but none of them seem to work. i am get the notion, that this is relat to electron. if this is relat to the main and render processes, pleas let me know. i have not work with ipc so far, sinc it was not needed.mi script.j file look like this:direct in my index.html. therefor i delet the requir in my script.j and it worked. i have tri this for the current module, but without success. i think this is becaus there is some python and c++ involv in the modul (it had visual studio and python as a requirement).can you pleas help me understand what the correct way is to implement this in an electron environment?
