i am tri to pass a string from render to main use the ipc process. for some reason it a) fire repeatedly, and b) onli send one letter at a time, even though i can definit see that the whole string is set befor sending. what the heck is go on and how do i compress this back to a singl call that has the correct string in it?renderer:edit:on clue to the puzzle, usernam was a state hook variable, i swap it out with a liter string and it now send the entir string, but is still send sever times. so half this problem may be that electron doesnt play well with react hook logic.
