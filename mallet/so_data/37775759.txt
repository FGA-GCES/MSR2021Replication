tl;dr: i need to check whether to disabl or enabl a menu item each time the contain menu is opened. how should i do it?details: in an electron app main menu i have a menu item that should onli be enabl when the user has certain kind of data in the clipboard - think of it as a specif kind of past function.access the clipboard and evalu the data valid is easy, but i can't find a way to perform the evalu onli when the menu contain this particular item is opened.th data will be come from outsid my app, so i could check the clipboard content whenev the window focus event fires. anoth option would be to do polling. neither is veri elegant, and i'm hope for a more sensibl approach.
