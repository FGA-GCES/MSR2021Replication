after sweat blood and tear i'v final manag to set up a node c++ addon and shove a web-platform standard .bounti updatei understand this would be sort of easier/poss if i were compil electron and/or chromium myself, but i'd rather not get involv in that mainten hell.i was wonder if it would be possibl without do that, and as far as my research goes, i'm convinc i need 2 thing to get this done:th relev header files, for which i believ blink public should be adequatea chromium/blink librari file (?), to resolv extern symbols, similar to the node.dylib filealso, as i said, i believ i could compil chromium/blink myself and then i would have this lib file, but that would be a mainten hell with electron. with this in mind, i believ this question ultim come down to a c++ link question. is there ani other approach to do what i'm look for?editscriptprocessornod is not an option in my case, as it perform make it near unus in production. this would requir to process audio sampl on the ui/main thread, which is absolut insane.
