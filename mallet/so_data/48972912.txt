i don't know how to start the question, but the main problem is that i can't make the 3 technolog work together: electron + typescript + webpacki'v encount few boilerplates, but in them either the whole typescript is built with tsc (instead of webpack), or onli render-part is built with webpack, and the main-process (main.js) part is written in pure js.so i was wonder if anybodi has or know where to find a boilerpl project to start the new electron + typescript + webpack project?a far as i understand it should be configur to build separ main-process and render-process part of the applic (probably, their config might be different).thank in advance.
