problem with electron is that instal is minim 200mb. our last releas of the program is here https://youtube-muziek-downloaden.nl and if you go to download program it is 700mb and right now it is on github and download is not that fast. so from user expiri is veri bad.i know that microsoft team is made also with electron js, but their instal is different. you download small exe file and you start it and then it goe and download the real team and then instal it. now my question is how can i do the same like microsoft team did? with visual studio (c#) or there are other tools? what is the name of this kind of installers, so i can googl it. or tutorial? ani help would be great.
