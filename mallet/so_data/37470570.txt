i'm tri to build a soundcloud desktop app use electron, and i'm struggl to understand how to get the authent key. in the snippet below from the soundcloud api they explain that you can use a "custom protocol scheme" to use as your redirect uri. you authent mobil and desktop applic the same way you do for server-sid web applications. to make the flow smoother, you can use a redirect_uri with a custom protocol scheme and set your app as a handler for that protocol scheme. for example, your redirect_uri could be someth like my-app://soundcloud/callback. soundcloud api authent docsi this possibl use electron?
