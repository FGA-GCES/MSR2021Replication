how can i proper add border to a frameless electron browser window?mi frameless window height is accord to the content in the page which make it difficult to add border around it. this is how i'm do it now: 1) i'm ad the border to html:the issu is it is not pixel perfect. sometim it work fine but sometim when html bodi content increas or decreas i get a bit smaller height electron window than the content. which hide the bottom border and i need to scroll up to see that border. if i increas the height a bit then next time i get some white space left below the bottom border. width is not an issu as it is alway fixed. as you can see in the below image, bottom border is hidden a bit becaus of smaller electron window size as compar to the content of html body.so how can i make it pixel perfect?
