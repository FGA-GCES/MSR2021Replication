i'm build an app in electron boilerpl and need to associ a custom file type in the window registri and mac plist in order to open these file in my app.th mac seem fair straight forward and have found some info from other that have manag to do this so not too concern with mac.on the window side my first thought is to just use the winreg npm to write the key to the registry. seem easi enough in theory, the onli problem is the doc for how to use winreg is pretti sparc at best.i'm abl to run the exampl code fine and spit out the autorun program so it instal and work fine and reading/output stuff make sens to me. what i can't seem to find much info on is actual write new key to the registry, i'm assum i would use create(cb) to do this but i can't seem to get it to work and honest just the create(callback) structur doesn't realli seem to make sens sinc there realli no logic there to pass the key, i'v tri create('key to add', function() { but i'm sure that not how you'r suppos to do it henc it doesn't work lol.bas all i realli want to do is someth like this (taken from c# example):how to actual add new registri key valu within node winreg?
