is it possibl to connect a clojurescript repl to a node-webkit applicationmi cljs code is as simpl as:i was follow the modernclj tutori and i can connect via the repl when i host the html page via an http server, but when it host in node-webkit it doesn't work for me. are there some trick i can use to make it work? i was abl to connect to node-webkit via the script-tag in lighttable, but this would mean that i have to use lighttabl for the repl (which might be okay sometimes). i would just like to have a plain vanilla leinigen clojurescript repl that talk to my node-webkit app. i had a look at this post but that didn't help.
