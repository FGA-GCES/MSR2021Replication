so i'v been look around for answer but haven't been abl to find ani up to date solut to my problem. so my use case is pretti simple, i want to be abl to check the onlin status of a list of user at my organis use skype for business. open chat with them is simpl enough, but actual get the onlin status has shown to be a challenge.i'v been look into the sdk but it seem a bit over the top for my use case, and i haven't been abl to get web ticket authent work (i'm implement this in an electron app). even if i got that far, would i have to make an account with specif onli the contact i need ad and use that as authentication?sorri if this is a stupid question, but it seem like the sdk/api is a bit over my level and i'm miss something. do i need to add in my own server middlewar between the node/electron-app and their api or someth similar maybe?ani help is great appreciated.
