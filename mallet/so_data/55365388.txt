so i am make a local app use javascript , react and electron and i want it to be abl to work just fine without internet.i can't use localstorag becaus the data might get delet if the user delet the cache.i tri reading/writ use differ modules, none of them work most becaus of cros. use xmlhttprequest and ajax doesn't work either and am run out of time.when i use them on the test server, they return the index.html for the mainpag (they can at least access that ... and still they can't read the data) but when i tri it on the build i get cor the error.mi idea for now is to enabl cor on my webpag sinc i have no worri about secur : the app will run onli offlin so there is no danger.but after mani hours...i didn't find a solut to do it on the client side.if anyon has an idea or suggest i would be grateful.i tri : fs,filereader,filesaver, $.ajax,xmlhttprequest
