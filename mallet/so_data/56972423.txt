in my electron app, i have code a restclient which is execut in main and render process. the first request, done in the main process, is done with the net librari from electron and it success use the system proxi settings.th next request, execut in render process cannot use net library, becaus this belong to main only. therefor i switch to normal https request, but this doe not use system proxi settings.i there a way to use the system proxi in the render process?edit: mayb a more general question: what is the best practis in electron to make web requests? is there some standard way to use http/https, request, net or fetch? which way would use the system proxy?
