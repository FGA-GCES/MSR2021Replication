i'm tri to creat an electron desktop app which has a django applic at it backend. there are sever tutori and blog which mention how this can be achieved. i'v tri those and it seem to be working, howev there are some issues. one of them for me is how to server django in this case? for me the current way of do it creat some unwant delay make the app slow to start...generally, what need to be done to creat an django/electron app is to packag (i'm use pyinstaller)th django app into an stand-alon execut and then bundl that into an electron app. the question is which server should be use for this case to server django befor packag it with pyinstaller? at the moment i'm use cherrypi as a wsgi web server to serv django. howev - is there a better altern know that this will be use in an electron desktop app? mayb someth faster, or more suitabl for this task? what is the typic way of handl django in this case?
