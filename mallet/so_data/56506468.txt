the secur context of my question is as follows:i current have an electron desktop applic which run my webapp. insid my app there is a featur which allow a authent user to access a document(pdf) which is password protected. the document is prepar on server and password is generat use sha256 hash of 10 charact string. the 10 charact are made up of two part 1) variabl doc id and 2nd fix salt.on the client insid electron current i have a nativ node modul which was written in c and compil use node-gyp. i make a call to this modul which contain the code to generat the same password use the two part of the password. the whole purpos of have this nativ node modul on the client was that as the modul is a compil binari it can not be revers engin and no one can access my secret salt. if salt is discov then the other part is easi to find and henc all doc are access to attacker.i read about webassembl and how it compil lower languag code to wasm which can then be load in to browsers. this effect mean i can use the same c code that i use in my nativ modul but now over the web instead of in electron.mi doubt were on the secur and revers engin part of wasm modul that get produced. i read that it is possibl to revers engin and get back the c file from wasm but the format which it give is not exact the same as sourc and how much can it help the attack is again a question.som thread that i have read https://twitter.com/jebdec/status/1012749064696295425?lang=enhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17507767https://www.reddit.com/r/webassembly/comments/8qmxjv/can_we_decompile_wasm_to_ccsource/apart from secur concern i think i mayb use wasm for a wrong purpos here as be on the open web if there is code the sourc of which is not viewabl and auditable, it present a veri larg secur issu on the whole. ani comments/advic will be helpful.
