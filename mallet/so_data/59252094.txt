i have been look around the web for a solut to this idea but as of now, i onli found instruct on how to show the develop tool which i am obvious do in debug build already. sinc i onli want to display the js consol in releas build i thought, i'd ask you guy for some idea on how to do this or if it even possibl in general. the reason whi i'd like to display the consol is becaus i'm log debug informaton of to the consol and in case that someth isn't work as expect it'd be help if the user could send me that log. i am alreadi use sentri for error but the log in sentri obvious do not contain the debug output. so doe anyon know if it is possibl to access the consol output from within an electron app?
