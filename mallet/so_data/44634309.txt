i have a littl problem with nw.js. i'v "googlised" for mani day (weeks) but i can't find ani solution.so, i use nw.js as client to connect to an intern server.it work like a classic web site. we can access to this site with the ip address (192.168. etc...) with a web browser or with my nw.js app.with ani browser on ani computer, it work perfect but with nw.js, when the applic stay in background for a long time (a least 1 or 2 hours) the applic seem to freez for few minut as we click on it to bring it in the foreground.th window and the page are appear but noth respond.it look like nw.js restart ine background.aft a coupl of minutes, everyth work again.i'v tri to send a request to the server everi 5 minut so nw.js would stay aliv buy it didn't worked.i have the same result with nw.js in 2 differ compani (2 differ building, 2 servers, no link between companies).do anyon have met this kind of freeze?ed think i have someth new.aft a time, the memori usag of the 4 nw.js process is extrem reduced. from about 80 mo to 4 mo for example. the problem come at this moment.i think it link with the automat tab discarding.mayb if i put in the file "package.json".i'm not sure about this chromium flag.
