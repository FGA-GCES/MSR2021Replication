i am creat a desktop app with electron alongsid mongodb as my data store. i am send data retriev from mongodb (in main process) to the render process. my goal is to receiv updat data from mongodb everi time the data changes. is there a way to automat and continu get the updat data and then chang the tabl data in html (render side).i'v tri to set an interv that will get the data everi 10 seconds, (inspir by how ajax works) but it failed. i'v also tri to implement an event listen for data chang in mongodb from main process that will emit a signal and then send new data and updat it, but it got too complic and confus and also failed.
