i am creat an electron app where i need to scan and updat file which need root permission. i know i can run such command use sudo.exec() in that way: and even i can put multipl command in a script and execut them with singl sudo.exec(). in my case, command need to be execut at differ point of time and i cannot execut them with a singl script. it is annoy for user to grant permiss again and again. i tri to do it anoth way (to run a piec of code where everyth that requir root permiss can be executed). for that, i post anoth question here. but it seem that it is not possible.now i want a way to get permiss onc when use instal app (as most of the app doe after user instal them) and be abl to use throughout the app sudo.exec() or some other method to execut command (prefer also the code fs.readdir, etc) that requir root permission.
