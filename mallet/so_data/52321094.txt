i am use data tabl to display dynam data which keep changing, the data is store in an array and the array length keep changing(might increas or decrease). i have set an interv of 1000 millisecond to keep the data tabl updated. but sinc i am use paging, whenev i go to a differ page rather from page 1, i am redirect back to page 1 automat when the data tabl get refresh everi 1000 millisecond (one second). is there ani way which can help me to prevent this? i don't think we can stop the reload of data tabl when data get updated, but i am look for ideas/hack one can do to prevent this issue. one simpl altern is to use a button which when click refresh the tabl rather than auto-refresh with some interval.}
