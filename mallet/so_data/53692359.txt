i am veri new to electron, tri to use it to build a cross-platform app which should be abl to run nativ on the machines. on the server side, i alreadi have an applic which expos a rest api, document with swagger.now i am tri to generat a client stub for this swagger definition, which i can then use with electron. how is that accomplished? should i just generat js code and use it (how would that work?)? or is there anoth (better) way to do it as electron has build in function to access rest api likei spent a consider amount if time search for a solut and did not find one. now i wonder if that is such an uncommon scenario to use electron as framework access rest apis, and auto-gener the code use swagger codegen.
