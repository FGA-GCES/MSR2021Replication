i have been given the task of build an electron applic that help you organ your music folder. the user choos a directory, the app recurs goe through all file and order them in a tree-view form group by artist -> album -> song - i have alreadi complet this part.th second part of the assign is that i can give the user the abil to batch replac the name of a song (some song don't have an artist, some don't have an album, etc). this is done by give the user the abil to write a regular expression, and when he click the "replace" button, the app batch replac all the match song with the replac word and whos the progress to the user.for example, let say i have 200 song by "nirvana" and i want to replac nirvana with a differ name, i need to show the user how mani song were match to the regex, replac them one by one (this i will most like do through the fs module) and let the user know how mani file were changed. i also need to give them the option to abort the operation. abord the oper stop immedi but file that were chang will nor revert back if i click on abort.ani help on this will be veri much appreciated. i will sum it up with the follow questions:1) what the best data structur to hold all of the song so that i can use regex on it later and filter it to song that match my expression?2) how do i show the number of chang song as the function iterates. how do i abort it midway?thank you veri much!
