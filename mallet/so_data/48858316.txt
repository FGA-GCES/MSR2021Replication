i am tri to learn electron, but am run into an issu with the pluralsight tutori i am using. i instal the electron-prebuilt module. i get an error everytim i run "npm start". the window open as expected, but the error messag that pop up in a dialog box kind of ruin the whole thing. here is the error:uncaught exception:typeerror: cannot read properti on of undefin at object.ther more to the long error messag but it won't let me copi and paste, and the rest of the error just refer to the locat of the suppos problem on line 14 of my main.j code. here is my main.j file:it indic that the browserwindow object i creat doesn't have an "on" method, but i know this to be fals per the electron documentation:https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-windowso i'm think that the valu of mainwindow just isn't be set. i could tri instanti mainwindow with a new browserwindow object at the time i declar it, but i get an error messag if i tri that indic that i can onli instanti browserwindow object in readi functions.
