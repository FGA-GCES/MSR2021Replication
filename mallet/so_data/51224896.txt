i am look for a way to captur a screenshot of a vs code extens host window. this window is open when my extens test are be run (this is come from the default yeoman templat for vs code extensions).i cannot use my extens context as the extens onli has access to the vs code api and vs code run extens in a differ node process from the electron one (main or renderer). ipc is use through the api instead of run extens in-process.i can run this code in an electron render process (use devtool or as a part of the electron applic script) to captur the electron window: it doesn't throw an error, but doesn't attach the debugg either.
