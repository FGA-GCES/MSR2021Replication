there are mani question in stack overflow and the internet in general regard this error, however, the context in which most of them are ask and answer doe not match mine. i am make a galleri app with electron. the idea is for someon to drag a folder into a dropzon in the app, and the app open the folder, iter through each item in the folder, if it find a folder, it just display the name of the folder, if it an image, read the imag and display it to the user. (note, i have not explicit check the file type to be image. i am drag a folder whose content i am certain are either an imag or a folder...i will add type check later). here is my code. i am follow this post, and an exampl by sitepoint. instruct in the first link go as far as iter through each content of the folder, which i have success done. the second link show how to display the imag when it is drag and dropped. the onli issu is that in my app, instead of drop an image, the user will drop a folder and iter through it contents.how do i solv this error?
