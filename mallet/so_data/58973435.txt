i'm creat an electron applic that use websocket to communic to a client application, but i'm experienc an issue: the client can connect to the server via websocket but when it come to send messag from the client to the server, it doe not work.it seem that the server is just simpli not receiv the messages.server-side:so far these are my findings:i have my websocket server implement on a render process. it seem the problem behind this small detail, becaus if i put the same code on the main process, everyth work just fine (but it cannot be a solution, i need it on the render process).interest i can alway connect to my websocket, so it seem that the socket is available, it just the messag that somehow cannot be emmit or receiv on the server sideth messag problem could be solv by connect to my server with anoth client and send a message. weird at the moment i connect with a new client, my messag that were sent befor (with anoth client) are trigger and the server receiv it, and then repli too. but then it doesnt work again, so i need a new client to connect again and send one messag to solv all the stuck client messages. (hope i was clear here, it a bit confusing)not that i'm not share the client code, but there is no point to show, sinc everyth work fine when i'm put my code to the main process, or if i just run this js file with node itself. the onli problem is the integr between electron render process and websocket communication.hop to find the answer soon, this communiti has alway prove to be veri strong in solv issu like this! :)
