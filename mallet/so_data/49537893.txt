i have a react base electron app and it run attroci slow for the first 15 second to 2-3 minut of startup. i'm tri to track down the issu so i open the devtools, go to the perform tab and click the record ‚óè button. the bar show how much of the record memori has been use up fill up veri quickly, much quicker than most app so i stop it as soon as i can (between 1/8th and 1/4th then entir bar) usual in about 1 a second or less. chrome/electron then take 30-40 second to parse/process the data befor it show anyth but when it finish it show almost nothingi there a known issu like this and a known workaround? a way to get more info out of devtools? note that onc the app is run smooth i get more normal read from devtool but fix that first 2-3 minut is turn out to be fair difficult with no info.
