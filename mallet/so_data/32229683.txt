i am look for a matur solut to packag a html5 project (html5+javascript+css) as a desktop and mobil app. the applic is current function on the web but for conveni i want to offer it as an mobil app (at least for android and ios) and as a desktop app for window and mac.i'm not use ani mobile-specif featur (compass, contacts, camera), howev the applic should have it own webview (chromium-based?) to ensur it function the same everywhere.som thing the app should be abl to do:load and save file (via brows dialog if support by the os)access localstoragesupport web workerssupport facebookso far i wasn't abl to find someth to fit all my requirements. i'v seen desktop-on solut (nw.js, electron) and mobile-on (phonegap) and i'm not sure about their support for the featur i need. webkit browser don't allow web worker for file:/// protocol; ie doesn't allow localstorag with file protocol.id i'd use one solut to packag the app for all platform with minim chang to the sourc code.
