alright, to be honest, i have no idea if this situat is specif to my comput or to ani linux user... but hear me out.i have code in github atom text editor on window 8.1 platform before. love it, so when i switch to linux (ubuntu 15.10 wily), the first thing i did was to download atom linux build and instal it on my system. it start out realli great. it was as fast as i thought, even faster than it window counterpart, so i was fair pleased.howev throughout the day i have reinstal linux and reinstal atom - and it was just very, veri slow. i was edit a markdown file and it lag for 2 second to posit the cursor onto where i clicked. i thought it may have been one packag that was the culprit in eat up cpu/memory, so i delet all the packag and start on a clean slate.noth changed, for some reason.then i decid to check the system monitor sinc there must be someth go on, becaus ever sinc i'v reinstal ubuntu 15.10 (i play around with some configur file befor and screw the system up...) and reinstal atom - everi time i start up atom, my cpu would get veri hot and the fan just get super loud. evid that is not a good sign.behold, the culprit:p.s. see that it my first question, i may be violat some standard and netiquett on se/so, either through the way i voic my question or ani reason realli - i don't know. if that is the case, pleas forgiv me as i still have a lot to learn about stackoverflow and this amaz communiti which help me through my journey of coding. thank you wonder folk in advance.
