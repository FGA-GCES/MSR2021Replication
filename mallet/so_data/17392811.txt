i'm look for a way to refer with it not a valid option, howev becaus my stylesheet are spread enough (it a complex app, i have someth like layouts/something.css main.css and similar things), it a big issu have to rewrit alway the ../ for everi url.what option do i have? in this case, the javascript option is not that bad as you may think. the other idea was run a realli small webserver, which should onli serv static things, but this need to be portable, cross-platform and shouldn't need install.i thought it was possibl to solv this with basic html and css, but it look like it not, while i can add "base" tag dinam through javascript, there isn't someth similar for css.
