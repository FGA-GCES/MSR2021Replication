after read electron secur tutorial, i disabl for that matter). this also mean that i am unabl to use ipc, even though i wouldn't be abl to use ipc anyway becaus it json serial my custom objects, which essenti caus object slice by convert my custom object into a pojo.with that said, what is the correct way to secur communic between the main process and the render process. i want to creat a singleton app instanc in my main process, access it in the render process (e.g., load configur from disk, and then allow the user to view/edit it from the renderer, save the chang back to disk) as secur as possible.i have look at some other similar topic (e.g., like this one) and it still doesn't work; besides, even if it worked, it a hack and i'd like to avoid hack if there are better way that i'm just not find on my own.
