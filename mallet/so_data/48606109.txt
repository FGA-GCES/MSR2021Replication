sinc i'm unabl to use sqlite in a node-webkit app, i'm look at lokij but i cannot seem to find an easi way of make join or some kind of relat between 2 datasets.on dataset is artist and the other is media.sinc it could possibl hold 5000 artist and a million medias, i think it would be better to avoid repetit by make the artist a subdocu of a media. also if i modifi the artist of 1000 media entries, it would requir a lot of write instead of just updat one singl entri in the artist dataset.th onli join i found creat the return json as followed:i look at nedb which offer join more easili but wasn't updat for over 2 year now. and i cannot get sqlite3 to compil for nodewebkit 0.28.0 and got no answer from so. anyway, lokij look way more fun to play with anyway sinc it in memori and on disk.so how can i join artist and media?thanks!
