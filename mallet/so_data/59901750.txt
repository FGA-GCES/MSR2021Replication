i have an applic that was previous written in flex and air. this applic would start up three child process use the air nativ process api. two are dotnet applic and one is a java applet. when air would start the applic they would show as individu process in the detail tab of task manag and also as sub process of the air applic in the process tab as shown belowth posprint applic is a print applic that we send request to and when a request was sent, if no default printer is set it will open the standard window dialog to choos a printer and you could click cancel or ok as normal.w are in the process of migrat this applic to electron and angular.origin i was spawn the process use a node modul call cross-spawn but for some reason we had problem send request to the spawn application, it would receiv the request but then it would do noth with it.w then use the normal node child_process modul and use execfil to launch the applications. this allow us to send our request (we actual send http request to the java applet as a middlewar and the java applet speak to posprint). these request are reach posprint and the dialog is now launch use this approach of launch the applications. the problem is that in the electron application, the dialog is open behind the electron applic and a user must alt+tab or move window around in order to see the dialog. at first it was thought that it was becaus we were use 64-bit electron and launch a 32-bit posprint application, but after we creat a 32-bit version as well, we were still unabl to get the dialog to show up in front. we'v also tri the other way of spawn process via spawn and exec but the dialog will never open in front of the electron application.
