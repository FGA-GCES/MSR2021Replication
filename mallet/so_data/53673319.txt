i setup an express server with mongo to record consol log dure debug test of an electron app use react.i simpli use ajax to send what i would normal print with console.log. this work fine with individu event i want logged, but how do i export the entir chrome style consol as an object so that anyth that would reach the consol (example: webpack messages, messag from other compon etc) would all be access as one object that i can do a post on.bas a way to record everyth that you would see in the consol whether it was from a 3rd parti packag or that i expressli log myself. is there a consol dump all method of some sort i'm not see in the chromium/electron/react docs?example:that particular method seem to log the electron node side fine when i use it in the electron main.js. howev i can't get it to work within my react components.
