i'd like to write a gui for an applic that i wrote in ocaml i use mac os main so i'd like that it look good at least on this platform, but even better if it can be multi-platform. i know that traditionally, peopl have use lablgtk, or wrote nativ gui in a differ language. i'm not familiar with most recent option though. for one thing, i may be abl to compil my program to javascript. doe this give me new options? is this stabl enough to be use without too much trouble? more specifically, i'm think about electron.basically, i'd like to know what the differ option are, and how they compar in term of difficulti and look.
