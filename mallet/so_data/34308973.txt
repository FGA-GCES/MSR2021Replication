this is more of a request for general guidanc from experienc develop than a real question, so pleas bear with me.a you may have guessed, i come from web development. late i have been interest in develop comput assist product manag software, which i hope, will go gradual by develop modul until such a time we have enough to start build a full enterpris resourc plan software. (forgiv me if the term are incorrect, i'm struggl a bit with english).h my conundrum. be a web developer, i'd have hope to reutil my skill to that end, and with the surg of hybrid app and desktop app base on web languag (with the like of meteor and it librari electrify), i just can't help but wonder if these technolog are "adapted" to creat such -let not say complex- intric apps, henc the follow questions.ar these technolog matur enough for a develop of thisscal and commit over time. i'd hate to start on them just forthem to "fall out of fashion" and lose all traction.ar they adapt for this kind of development? compar tonat app -say in c# or java, are they truli suit for, say;intens databas management?in this endeavor i intend to recruit a small team (who areprimarilli come from nativ dev). is it safe to assum that thelearn curv will not be too steep, that they'll not becomehopeless lost at the earli stage of learning?given that these app will have to be high modular to allow forth hypothet entrepris resourc plan software, are hybridapp a viabl option?and the final question might seem somewhat off-topic, but giventhat these app will be heavili reliant on form and databaseaccess, aren't web technolog just not the tool of the trade inthi case? even when associ with librari like react orangular, form creation and valid is a pain, wherea in idessuch as vs in c#, creat form equal drag them in a gui fashion from thedatabase; if i rememb correctly.thes are rough my interrogations. what i'm hope here for is for you to shed an experienc light on my situat if you can, and if you have ani other remarks, pleas feel free to comment.
