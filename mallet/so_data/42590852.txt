i'm a refuge from the flex/actionscript world and i am "porting" (basic rewriting) a larg legaci flex app to javascript use electron as the runtim engine. i'm learn as i go, do small test to explor the function and appropri of various javascript librari and frameworks.thi is a "presentation" type desktop app use local files(e.g. a powerpoint, keynote, itun type app) and i need to enabl a user to import, tag and organ mani imag and video assets. i need to be abl to move/copi assets, deal with duplic filenames, creat a db record for each file, creat group of files, etc. and then of cours be abl to access all of these at runtime. while it would be fun to write this from scratch, it would be a lot of work and it occur to me that there might be an exist librari or cms framework i could adapt for this. is that idea misguided? is there an exist solut for this type of requirement?
