a user of my app report an issu today about author the user with googl (use oauth 2.0). so far the applic was open a new browserwindow (node integr disabled, session is separ from the main application). you can see the implement here sinc the librari is oss. i am use this to author the user to access applic data on googl drive.today after log in i see the follow message: this browser or app may not be secure. tri use a differ browser. if you'r alreadi use a support browser, you can refresh your screen and tri again to sign in.th learn more link has a section for developers. this section has 2 links. one is how to upgrad the applic to pwa. becaus the applic is an api test tool it won't be possibl to run it in a web browser.th second link point to a document describ how to migrat to author for nativ application. howev describ flow requir authorization_cod grant. this mean i need to includ oauth secret into my application. electron application, however, is still web applic and there no notion of compil sources. i would expos client secret to the public which is not secured. potenti i could build a server applic to support it but the app is oss project. it doe not have fund to run a server for authorization.mi question is now how should i implement oauth 2 for electron applic then. i can't use pwa and server author flow (code grant) is far from ideal in this case.
