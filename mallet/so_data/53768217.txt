i am run code that is be run insid of an electron app. i do not have control over the electron app (it microsoft teams). insid of my code, i'm tri to creat a pop up window that doe some authent and then send a messag (via postmessage) to the open that all is complete. (the open will close the pop up and reload.)i'm have a coupl of issues: from the pop-up window, window.open is null. this prevent me from send a messag back to the parent window. i'v seen this issu detail in electron issu threads, but the solut are alway for dev who have control over the electron environment. i do not.th pop up open in a new full web page, not a pop up. i cannot control the width or height of the pop up window. from a differ bug (navigator.languag is an empti array), i can surmis that microsoft team is run an older version of electron (3.x). not sure if that a showstopp or not.
