i am tri to observ the network traffic from anoth window applic that use socket.io and is built with electron.i can observ the socket.io messag when i run the applic in chrome, but i would like to observ it from my own c++ application, without have to run it in the browser.i have alreadi found out that the complet javascript code, as well as the socket.io messages, can be read direct from memori with a tool like cheatengine. however, i'd prefer to take a more robust rout than "guessing" memori locations.can you give me ani hint on where to start?
