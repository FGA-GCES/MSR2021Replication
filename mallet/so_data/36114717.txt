i'm build an electron applic that use googl youtub data api v3. for access the api, i decid to use the standard api key (instead of oauth, sinc i am not go to be access ani person data). but the problem is, i cannot hide the api key in my app, and i also cannot use referr restrict (referr restrict allow you to filter which web site can use your api key (bi http address)), sinc this is an electron app. so basically, if someon look at the sourc code (or even just at the develop tools), they can see the key, and use it freely.ani advic on what to do? thanks.
