i have the follow files:topnav.component.tsin the code, i am retriev version info about the environ that i am run on and updat the version properti and hope that it updat in my view. the call to getversioninfo() is async and use the ipcmain and ipcrender communic construct in electron. i am abl to verifi that these are work as expected. there are no error from neither angular nor electron.i have verifi that the version is inde come back in the arg param and be log to the consol as expected; however, it is not show up in the view until i navig around my app. this lead me to believ it has someth to do with the compon lifecycl and chang detect in angular 2. however, i am a bit of a newbi to both angular 2 and electron.ani pointer or idea as to what might be go on and how to fix it?
