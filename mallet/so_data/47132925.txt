i encount a nasti syntax error, when tri to use decor in an electron, react, redux project.a i state in the question, i run the compil stuff trough the "electron-prebuilt-compile" package. which come in handi and work fine until now.th npm page of this packag say it compil is empow by "electron-compile".electron-compil work for js es6/es7 (via babel) as state on their github page, what make me wonder whi i encount this "decorator" problem, as es6 or at least es7 come with this feature. see editani suggest on how to fix this error?electron-prebuilt-compil doesnt let me configur the webpack.config.mayb i have to set up webpack myself? if i do so, how to combin it with electron?edit as estus state in his answer: es6 doesn't includ decorators, but "babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy" does.
