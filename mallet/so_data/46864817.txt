from the command line, or from an application, i want to open a new browser instanc with a specifi size and position, and point to a specif url. i want to open a browser that act like a dialog box. ideally, i'd like to be abl to disabl "decorations" (like tabs, bookmarks, etc.). i do not want to open a new tab or pop-up window from an exist browser instance.i know electron or node webkit do this, but i just want to open a browser as that act as a gui front end for whatev back end i'm building.i'd be happi if it would work for a specif browser; say, chrome, or chromium.so, for instance, a python app (or c/c++, java, etc.) could start it web server, then open a browser of the proper size, point to "localhost:xxxx/whatever.html", and serv up data via ajax.kind of a univers singl page app front end...upd (solution?)th answer seem to be in two parts: 1) open the browser with command line switches, and 2) resiz the window in javascript.us chromium (or chrome), on the command line:chromium-brows --new-window --app=http://192.168.1.80:8080/index.htmlthen, within your javascript:window.resizeto(800,500)thi will bring up a new window and resiz it.thi is great. now, i can make an app in ani languag that allow me to open a web server. the user interfac is done in html, css, and javascript. the browser is open from within the applic use the proper command line switches.
