this is a node webkit applic that manag a bunch of webkit windows. each webkit window use signalr to connect to a mvc/webapi/signalr stack with no problems. each window connect to 1-3 hub over websockets. everyth work well. my client want to use signalr insid the base node applic that manag all the other windows. this is where thing are get interesting'... so although the node app is run in a webkit environ it is serv from the file system (header:origin=file://)so i have start up signalr like (no jsonp as i'm target websockets)signalr will then (correctly) fall back to sse and connect successfully. i can see the ident of the user serverside. i would realli like to understand whi i can't connect over websocket when the user is authenticated. if i delay all window from connect to the server via signalr until the user is authent then i also see the same behavior. ani help or clue would be great appreciated.
