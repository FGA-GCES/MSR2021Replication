i'm tri to do a debug step-by-step of my c++ addon that is use within a simpl electron app. the problem is that the break point are never triggered, even if i can see that visual studio load correct the .pdb file. what did i do wrong?i'm use visual studio 2019, with electron 5.0.4. the addon work just fine, and i can put a break point in the init function :i tri to launch my addon project with electron.ex as run time, i tri to attach my addon project debugg to the main tread of electron, it still doesn't work.i'd like the break point to stop in everi methods, and understand whi it doesn't work at the moment.
