i need to work on an old applic written with wpf and ms sql server compact edition. as a requir the app is execut from an usb stick (where also all the data is persisted) and the same should appli for the new system.in the new applic i would like to use nosql db to store the data (node-sqlite3 or npm-nosql). howev the record current store on the sql ce databas must be migrat to the new db or the same sql ce databas use again (even if i prefer to avoid this option). in the latter case, i have seen there is node-mssql as databas connector, but sql server ce is not among the support databases.th current sql ce schema is extrem simple, onli 4 tabl and less than 300 record in total. the applic is execut local by a singl user.i there a way to export the sql ce databas so that i can import it into the new database? are there better databas to be use with node-webkit other than the one aforementioned?
