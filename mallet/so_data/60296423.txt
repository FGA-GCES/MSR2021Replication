i'm creat an electron app that should show itself when a global shortcut key is pressed. for the shortcut key, i'm use iohook and that part work well.if i allow the window to be shown as normal dure startup of the app, window focuss on it (mi test is press alt to see which menu bar is activated).th problem is that if i start the program with or creat the window when i press the shortcut key, it open the window in the foreground but the focus is still on the app that i was on befor press the shortcut.i have fix this in the past with autohotkey but i want to make this app cross-platorm and prefer contain as much of my code as possibl within nodejs.
