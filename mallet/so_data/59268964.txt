i have a strang requir with an electron applic where i need to be abl to forc the document to render at a specif resolut and then stretch or squash it to fit the window. for example, i need to specifi that the content size is 1920x1080 but then need to squash that down to an actual window size of say 1280x960. i have tri to implement this in the dom by set a fix bodi size and scale this down to fit the window but this has a knock on effect on other transform and anim which expect the non-scal version. i need a solut which work outsid the dom so the document behav as if it actual is run in a 1920x1080 window but then the render result is scale up or down to fit the actual size of the window.i there ani way to achiev this?
