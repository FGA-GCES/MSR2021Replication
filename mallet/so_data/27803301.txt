i'd like to start work on html desktop app for window again. i haven't yet decid on which framework i am gonna build it on, so i am rather flexibl about this. now.. there is one requir that i have though: within two of the app that i want to creat i want to have a transpar background, that is not onli transpar but will also blur what underneath it - similar to an effect you got all over osx yosemit and the latest iosher you can see a pictur of the effect that i rough want to achiev : https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/107587/screenshots/1598097/vk_os_x_player_dribbble.pngnow, doe anyoneon know how to achiev that in.. say.. appj or chrome packag app or with tidesdk or node webkit ?edit - when i tri to do the suggest stuff with an appj programm i just get a black background. not a transpar one. i think i also know how to achiev that, in a browser. but not in an app that is suppos to run on a desktop.
