the question is: how to access multipl document return from a nedb find command.understand some insight i gain use nedb in nodejs. regard doc return via nedb find and access key valu pair:thought this would work: docs.current.temp_f but it doesn't.thi works: docs[0].current.temp_f doe work.background and detail:i'm new to javascript, nodejs, nedb, and have never use mongodb, but understand nedb has a similar api.th reason for my post is: i use this site a lot, but could not find an answer to my problem. i final figur it out myself, and am post it here so i can return a contribut to the community. i'm access wunderground use their api. work great. i then push the result into nedb use the nedb api insert command. there are multipl exampl of this available, here and elsewhere.us the nedb api find command, i was abl to retriev my data. i could print it out use console.log(). again, multipl exampl here and elsewher for this. wunderground return a json object (if request in this format), in the form {response:{...som data}, current_observation:{...som data...temp_f...som more data}}, which can be insert into the nedb database.us the nedb api find command (e.g., db.find({},function(err,docs) {console.log(docs);} i was abl to print out my data. but my desir was to just obtain a few key:valu pairs, not the whole structure. i thought that someth like docs.current_observation.temp_f would do the trick, but this was alway undefin and caus an error.what i didn't understand, becaus i'm so new in this area, is that nedb is return a "set" of data; an array of json object in this case, sinc i was insert json objects. i never saw this mention anywher on the npmjs.com site for nedb. so i want to alert other like myself that lack this knowledge.her what ultim work to obtain the key:valu information: console.log("temp_f: ", docs[0].current_observation.temp_f);wher i'm access the array element 0.of course, this would probabl end up in someth like a for/in loop.i would be interest in see ani addit idea on retriev key:valu from the result set returned, if you know of any.
