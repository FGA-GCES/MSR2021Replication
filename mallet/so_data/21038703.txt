i'm build a node-webkit app, am listen for keypress event (in an angular directive). most combin of keypress are working, but ctrl-f and ctrl-a are both not working.thi problem is specif to node-webkit. i'v got the ctrl-a etc. work in the browser, but not in node-webkit. i'm listen for keypress with the usualdocument.bind('keypress',function...)window.bind('keypress', function...)window.bind('onkeypress', function...)window.bind('keydown', function...) ani suggestions? remember, the other combin of key ctrl-shift-o, etc. are working. as this is a node-webkit app, there is no browser base find function, and i'm disabl the select all'.
