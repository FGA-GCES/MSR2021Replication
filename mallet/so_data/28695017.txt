i am creat nodewebkit and webrtc base desktop applic for video streaming. while creating, i am tri to use getusermedia api but get the below error on my linux box. [15464:0224/125017:error: browser_main_loop.cc(162)] run without the suid sandbox! see https://code.google.com/p/chro... for more inform on develop with the sandbox on. attention: default valu of option force_s3tc_en overridden by environment.with some help from google, i found out below detail about suid. suid (set owner user id up on execution) is a special type of file permiss given to a file. normal in linux/unix when a program runs, it inherit access permiss from the log in user. suid is defin as give temporari permiss to a user to run a program/fil with the permiss of the file owner rather that the user who run it. in simpl word user will get file owner permiss as well as owner uid and gid when execut a file/program/commandaccord to my understanding, node-webkit (nw.js) doesn't need a sandbox to run. pleas correct me if i am wrong. i am run the same nw applic on my mac os x maverick and it is run flawlessly. i am realli confus here becaus of the below questions.should i instal a chromium sandbox befor run nw on linux (though i haven't found ani such direct on nw.js github page)?if not, what chang i need to make to my ubuntu 12.04 lts so that my applic won't ask for a sandbox?
