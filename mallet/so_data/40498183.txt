is it possibl to fork a child_process from an electron render process? i found some post across the net, but there were no hint how help me to get my code working. i creat a module, that fork child processes. this code works, when i run this with cmd and under node. but when i tri to integr it in my electron app, i can not communic with the child.send() method.outdated: the main problem now is, that i think electron spawn new child process and do not fork. because, when i look at my task manag i see onli one instanc from electron. when i run the code in a node env, i see there were fork multipl node instances. the reason whi i prefer to fork my child process in multipl node instanc is, that i want to make mani imag manipulation. so when i fork childs, then everi child has it own node instanc with memori and so on. i think that would be more perform then when i onli have one instanc who share the memori and resourc to all of the childs. the second unexpect behavior is, that the console.log statement in the child is not print to my cmd console. but this is the smaller one :)edit: after i analys my task manag a littl more in depth, i saw, that electron spawn multipl child process like it should.
