tl;dr: is it bad practic to use a global variabl to prevent code execut unnecessarily, and if so what are the alternatives?i have an electron applic that read a stream of real time data from anoth applic and output some element of it on screen. there are two type of data received, real time (telemetry) data of what is current go on and more static data that updat everi few second (sessioninfo).th first time a sessioninfo packet is receiv i need to posit and size some of the ui element accord to some of the data in it. this data will definit not chang dure the cours of the applic be used, so i do not want the calcul base on it to be execut more than once*.i need to listen for all sessioninfo packets, there are other thing i do with them when received, it is just this specif part of the data that onli need to be consid once. given the above, is this a scenario where it would be appropri to use a global variabl to store this inform (or even just a flag to say that this info had been processed) and use this to prevent the code execut multipl times? all my read suggest that global variabl are never a good idea, but short of allow this code to execut repeat i am unsur what altern i have here.*i recognis that allow this would probabl make no practic differ to my application, but this is a learn experi for me as well as produc someth use so i would like to understand the right approach rather than just bodg someth ineffici togeth and make it work.
