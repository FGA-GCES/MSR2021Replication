i'm current work on a nwjs (former node-webkit) applic for organ all file in a directory, regardless of type. the end goal will allow me to place all file in alphabet folders, base on a number of file properties.an exampl would be a folder that contain three files, let say an mp3, a wav file, and a .odt file. i'm need to read some arbitrari metadata off of each of these file so i can perform a "best guess" as to where i should organ the file.i found a few npm packag for read metadata from individu type of file (https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-exif for jpegs, https://github.com/43081j/id3 for mp3 tags), but noth prebuilt for this particular usage.if i were to write my own, is there anyth about the fs that built into nodej that would help?
