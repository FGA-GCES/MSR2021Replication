i'm write a react applic with a lot of modal (but onli one ever activ at a time with no nest modals), and i'm unsur of which of these two solut is prefer when it come to handl show and hide these modals:hav a state boolean variabl in the parent compon that determin whether or not the modal should be shown. if this boolean variabl is false, don't render the component. if it true, render it. allow the modal to influenc this event via a pass in prop callback it can leverage. exampl snippets:ther are also hybrid approaches, and other solut as well i'm sure. regardless, i suppos the essenc of my question is wonder about the prefer solut for show and hide modals: is it to alway render them and just toggl their visibility, or to actual toggl between ad and remov them from the dom? and, should the modal itself general control it lifecycl or should the parent?
