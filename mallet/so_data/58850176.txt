i'm work on an angular-electron-sequel app that allow me to read log from a databas table. however, i'm get the error "cannot read properti replac of undefined" when call the sequel constructor. i'v check a few articles, but haven't found a problem/solut that match mine yet.in my code where it breaks, it pass a user-defin connect object to an angular servic that handl reach out to the databas (via sequelize). paramet and not from an actual url. i see this behavior when a breakpoint is set. however, i'm not sure if sequel is suppos to notic the option be pass in and check for a host from there.
