we are build a cross platform (os) tool that requir both command line and graphic user interface.w select electron as our solut and got stuck while tri to get input from the user in cli mode. it seem that electron main process doe not support stdin on windows.window 10 with electron 8.0.0 the basic example:ther are some discuss about it around the web but not none of them with a concret answer.overcom this problem will make the deploy / releas process much easier for us so we are will to consid workaround / hack as well :)use librari like electron-prompt which use a dialog to prompt the user are not an option as they break the look and feel of the cli.thanks!
