i have made a few question about this already, but mayb this question would result in better answers(i'm bad at questions)i have one class, call foo, where i call an async start function, that start the process that the class foo was made to do. this foo class doe a lot of differ calculations, as well as posting/get the calcul use the node.j "requets" module.-i'm use electron ui (bi press buttons, that execut a function etc..) to creat and start the foo class-&#xd;&#xd;i called, the respons from the request "statuscode" still get print out when the request is finished.th answar i got, show some good logic, that i didn't know about, but the problem is that they all onli stop the request, the code hanld the request respons will still execute, and in some case trigger a new request. this mean that i have to spam the stop function until it fulli stop it.
