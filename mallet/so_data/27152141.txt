i have a node webkit app, part of which involv use child process in node to call pdftk (a separ command line program). i don't want my user to have to instal pdftk or use the command line, so i includ pdftk in the packag version of the node webkit app. if i run this packag app from the command line, it work fine - and i assum that becaus it use the version of pdftk that instal on my computer, not the one packag with the app.when i tri to launch the app by doubl click on an icon in the gui, as i'd want a user to be abl to do, i get a node.j error - child process enoent. i think that becaus when launch through the gui, it doesn't inherit the environ variabl (includ path) from my command-lin environment. i know i can set environ variabl as an option when i call the child process, but haven't been abl to figur out how to do that correctly. i'm not sure what variabl i should set, or what i should set it to. i suppos i'm not sure if it even possibl to call pdftk from within the packag app, or if i would need to have the user instal it on their own computer. ani help would be much appreciated.
