use casei'm build an app that has support for translations. the way i imagin it is that the app will come with english by default and will be sent around to differ places. when it arriv in germani (for example) a user will add german as a translat and then send it to france. the french user will be abl to see both the origin languag (engligh) and german. backgroundth app is a react web app wrap in electron.for the use case i implement the localstorag api to store content chang and switch between differ translations. problemsaft build the app as a portabl exe and test it i start notic that the content doesn't carri over to a new pc. it seem like the data is store on the system or someth els is happen (like localstorag get wipe when move the portabl exe to anoth machine).in my view, becaus i'm use localstorag and electron bundl the chromium browser with the web app i was expect localstorag to be save within the portabl app. would love to hear your opinion on thisthank a million.
