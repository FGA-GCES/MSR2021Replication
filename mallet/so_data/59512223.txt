i am work on a nativ applic in electron which should have the abil to import a docx templat and replac some part of the text, as well as insert an imag and two tables, keep the origin format and styles.i'v seen this can be done with docxtemplater, but imag and tabl are onli support in the enterpris version, which i definit cannot afford for this project. instead, i'm current use docx.j to generat the document from scratch, but i realli need the user to be abl to import a templat and have the applic replac the relev parts.i there a way (a reason easi way) to do this without use docxtemplater?
