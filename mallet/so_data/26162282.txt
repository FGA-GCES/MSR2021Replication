i'm make an app in node-webkit that show differ sites, video and pictur after each other, where i show the imag in an image-tag, the video in a video-tag and the site in an iframe-tag in an iframe, and i replac one with the other. the problem is that when i look in the chrome dev-tools, the dom node count keep increasing, as doe the document count. it look like when i replac an ifram with someth els (an imag or anoth website), it doe not get remov from memori (memori also increas over time). the video and imag tag don't have these leftovers.thi is a problem becaus it is suppos to run for a long timespan, and eventu this memori leak will kill the app.what i do is basic this:html:but then when i look at the timelin in the node that were ad when insert the ifram are not removed.can anyon help me with how to clear the ifram (and it content) ?
