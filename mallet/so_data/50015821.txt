i have a android app write with ionic, and it will call some c function with cordova. now, i need to make the same app to the desktop. i want to use electron. and the c code can run as nodej c/c++ addon in electron. but if i use the ionic in electron. i will got follow error when load the nodej addon:modul pars failed: xxx.node unexpect character''(1:0) you may need an appropri loader to handl this file type (sourc code omit for this binari file)th xxx.node is the c librari binari file.i googl some days, and found someon said that node run on the server side. ionic is client side, so ionic can't call the node modules. is that right? if that is right, how can i use the same ui code? i need to rewrit one or use other framework? thanks!
