i am creat a local desktop app in electron use javascript where i want to log each number a user choos use my app and add that number to a json file. but i onli want the app to be abl to updat the json, not the user.so for example, there is a textbox that say choos a number, the user type a number (837) and click submit. now i want to have the program store this number along with all the other number previous submit to an exist json file, like:im not a expert but i know i can encrypt the data so the user couldn't edit it, but then onc it run through the program it will have to be decrypt so the user could easili edit the json after, correct?also i have read i could hash the file to prove it the origin context, but as i need the program to edit the json this will not be possibl as the hash would change.i it even possibl to do this? i need a way the user cannot edit the data but the program can.
