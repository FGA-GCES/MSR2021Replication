is it possibl for me to quick send multipl async messag from my main process to a browserwindow?i would like to display a load screen that show initi progress of the main process. i would like to send mani messag quickly, for exampl "databas ready", "user collect loaded", "cach preloaded" etc, all without need to specif ask for each status updat from render first.a far as i can tell, i can't send with icpmain unless i'm specif repli to someth sent by the render first. i would like to have an open line of communic from main to renderer.would websocket be a better approach? or mayb someth else? thank
