currently, i am work on a desktop applic that allow user to click on button to run termin commands. i have near finish make this in electron, though i have run into one issu that i cannot work around. my applic is made up of two files: main.j and index.html. the javascript file display index.html, includ the need electron packages, and hold all of the function call by index.html. one of the packag that i am use is electron-preferences. this allow me to creat a simpl window to store user prefer in a json file as well as access and chang them. i have one function that allow the user to chang one prefer on the fly, however, i am have issu call this function from the index.html file. in the main.j file, an object call prefer is defined. in my html file, however, it say this object is not defined, thus it cannot run the program (i am includ the main.j in the html file through a script src tag). is there ani way to includ the prefer object, or some way to restructur the code so that i can call the function from a separ file?thank you in advanced!funct from main.js:
