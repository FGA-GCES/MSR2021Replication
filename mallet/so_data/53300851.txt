when i open a file use dialog.showopendialog, the open file get shown in the list of recent document under window 10. not much to say about the accompani code, it as simpl as:th electron doc specif mention how to make someth show up in the recent document list (on the recent document page), but make no mention about this undesir automat behavior, nor how one would go about undo it. i also couldn't find an issu about this.ther are method for clear the entir list (app.clearrecentdocuments), as well as ad an item to this list (app.addrecentdocument), but i need to remov an item from this list, for which there doesn't seem to be a method.a a sidenote, file which were not associ with my app also show up in the list (and again accord to the docs, for a file to show up in the list of recent documents, the associ has to be made).so how can i do this, or just simpli prevent a file from show up as such?
