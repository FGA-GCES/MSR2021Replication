today, i open up my visual studio code and saw that a new updat has been released. like ani other normal (and ignorant) user, i just instal the updat without ani research about the changes. it been month sinc i haven't had a problem with the updat so i assum this one would be no different. but after the update, "launch" option would no longer work!i have an electron/angularj app. this launch config simpli run the app. everyth was work fine befor the vs code updat but after the latest updat (v 1.22.1), the app fail to launch from within vs code.i can, however, run my app through command line, so there are no changes/problem with electron or others. the main electron process would fail to find a modul at $workspacefold (someth about electron.asar resolvepaths?).aft a coupl of hour of research, i found out that ad this simpl property, grant my wish:
