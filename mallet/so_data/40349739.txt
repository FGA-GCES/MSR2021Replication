i am tri to use electron 1.4.4 to creat a test client for test openid connect on our web site and have an issu with jqueri not work correctly.i open our site use a new browserwindow from the main process and see the page. when i look in devtool consol i see a lot of jqueri is not defin errors. when i load the same page in chrome, i do not see the errors.did a littl dig with the help of a ui co-work and he found a coupl of differences. in chrome 50 jqueri is defin on the window object (window.jqueri is a function) and modul is not defin (modul is undefined). in chromium 53 jqueri is not defin (jqueri and window.jqueri are undefined) and modul is defin (modul is an object).not sure if this is relev but the page is generat by drupal which is manag by a differ team.thanks, wes.
