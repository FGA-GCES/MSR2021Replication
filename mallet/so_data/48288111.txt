for learn purpose, i'm tri to creat a desktop eyedropp but i can't figur out how to retriev the color of a pixel behind a magnifi glass follow the cursor.in my head, i have to take a screenshot of the screen and display a zoom and crop version near the cursor. but how can i take screenshot without the magnifi glass mask the part i want?i thought about mask the magnifi glass while i take a screenshot and then re-display it again, but it seem veri shaki to me. how do other tool such as sip or kelir do that?i'm tri to do that with node.j and electron but i'm guess platform specif api are necessari for that.thi is a matter of design rather than implement so it could be with ani languag or platform: i'll adapt accordingly.
