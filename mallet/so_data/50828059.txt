i am creat a electron applic that look similar to googl chrome with multipl dynam tab for differ pages. the applic also support multipl open windows. i want to be abl to drag tab between these windows. i alreadi know how to send messag between my window with the ipcrender but i am come up against a few roadblocks:1) i cannot drag an html element outsid of a window. how can i drag the tab (or someth that look identical) outsid of the window?i'v found a discuss on the atom forum where someon claim they were abl to achiev this, but do not elabor on how. they claim "nativ html5 drag and drop in combin with ipc messag was the solution". someon els link a github exampl below, but the exampl has sinc been removed.2) how do i detect when a tab is drag onto anoth open window (mous releas on other window)?again the discuss suggest i use ipc messag to do this, but i have not found a way to get the id of the window you releas the mous on.edit:i have found a solut to issu 1. the mention discuss was right and use default html5 drag behavior was abl to creat the effect i wanted. issu 2 still stump me. i understand the concept of alert all other open window with an ipc messag to prepar for an incom drag but i am still unsur how to get the id of the window and the posit you drag to on it so you can send the tab inform to the correct place.
