i'm just get start with node.j and electron, and i'v seen various way both in the document and in exampl code on how to requir modules. specifically, i am tri to follow this tutorial. in this particular example, i think i am requir . secondly, is #3 prefer becaus it use in the documentation? or is #4 preferred? the comment in the program for #4 say "use new es6 modul syntax for everything". doe this mean this is the futur of javascript? and of course, i would like to know if these are just syntact differ or if they actual affect how the program is run.
