what the best way to integr with tfs and visual studio onlin in electron, use angularjs? the user can provid username, password, and url for the server, and i want to get projects, tasks, move task between states, creat new item etci have a project use angularj and electron. i want to get my projects, task etc from microsoft team foundat server (instal on-premise) and visual studio onlin too. i found document about basic auth and oauth to do this, but i guess oauth work onli for visual studio online, while basic auth work for both but don't let me take profil data (user name, etc). i see microsoft has a c# lib with full access, but to use it in electron i would need to write a web servic in c# or someth like this, and it would be much better if i write my app as a standalone, work with tfs api directly.
