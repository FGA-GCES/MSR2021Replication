i'm current tri to use a backdrop-filt in electron.js, to creat a blur-behind effect that'll work over dynam elements, instead of just over a singl background image.a it is not current support in stabl chrome, i'm use as as an experiment feature, as mention in extrem brief here. he doe mention not "prefixing" the css rule, but doe not mention to what or provid ani other context, so i am unclear what he is saying.i'm creat my electron window with:which current doe nothing, at all. am i do someth fundament wrong? is this still possibl in the modern version of electron? is this possibl by some altern experiment blink feature, if not?i'l admit some degre of concern it may be deprecated, as i cannot get other demo from github running, either, it appears.
