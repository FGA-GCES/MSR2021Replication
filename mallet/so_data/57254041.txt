i have a simpl app to save file base on electron quick start app. i pack it with electron-packag and when i use it on my local disc everyth work fine. but if i copi all folder with app to network disc in my compani app start well but when i tri save file app go down (sorri i can't attach screen. just all electron window is white and communic is devtool was disconnect from the page. onc page is reloaded. devtool will automat reconnect'. no other info in console).i think the problem is function. as i mention script is attach correct and when i start app from local disc, it work fine. so i'm sure app is written correct and the problem come from use on network disc. how can i fix this problem? thank for ani ideas.
