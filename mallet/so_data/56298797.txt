as far as i can see, test with jest or ani other test framework is imposs when use vue, nativ modules, and electron run as node. electron need to be run as node to allow nativ modul to work, sinc they have been compil against a particular version of electron, and this mean a version that is differ from ani node version.but if you call the test via the script section of package.json use this:sadly, the same problem occur if you run this use jest and electron. anyth with the nativ modul is fine. however, test that touch vue don't work.mock the nativ modul doesn't work sinc that bypass the export of the module, but it is still run in some way and caus an error. and i can't mock vue, becaus i want to test my code...i'd be happi to get ani jest or mocha or vue cli or ani solut working!
