for our project we need to be abl to test an applic i made use electron. the applic is just an svg file that contain button and "lamps". i am load the file with electron and then i use jqueri and javascript to access the button and lamps. imagin a battleship command desk but in an app, so visual represent of physic button and lamps. again, there is onli one singl svg file and noth else. the test need to be abl to click on an svg element insid the svg object, that mean svgobject.contentdocu need to be accessible.i tri use spectron with mocha, chai and chai-dom but no luck (i feel like these onli work for interact with html elements, i could be wrong though). we are still use electron 4 becaus in the latest updat (juli 2019) the svg get stuck in an ifram and access is imposs due to the same-origin policy, howev it work fine in electron 4.the applic also communic with backend (not my field so don't know what i'm talk about) use python-shell. onc you press a button on the applic it send an asynchron messag to pyshel which send it to the machin (can't say anymor about it sry) and the machin answer accord to python and pyshel send a messag back, and the button visual chang colour if the action and reaction were successful. i know there are some listen you can use so it not that important. more import is the inside-svg interact test program. i hope this is understandable. if not, let me know.
