i have an electron app. it send via a ipcrenderer.send in renderer.j a download event to an ipcmain.on listen in index.js:renderer.js:renderer.js:it seem like it is an asynchron issue. but i have wrap the queri in an async await function to prevent the two download event from overlap each other. and the log of the consol show it: first the file of the first valu in data3.project array are downloaded, then the file of the second valu in data3.project array are downloaded.so how can i make it happen that the file get save in the proper folder?
