i'm use electron and i need to be abl to send/rec from a server use tcp sockets. i have the client set up and i'm abl to send to the server (i can confirm the server is receiv this lines).however, i can't seem to figur out how to "listen/read" from the server when it repli back to me. this is the function i'm use to handl communic between my client and the socket serverhowev the "reading" is not working. the server is send the repli but my client is not abl to read it in order to show it back to me.what am i do wrong?sid note, the server is not a node.j server. it a simpl socket server done in, i belief, pascal. i'm abl to send/get repli from this same server use tcp socket in android, java, ruby, and mani other so it should be abl to work with electron.
