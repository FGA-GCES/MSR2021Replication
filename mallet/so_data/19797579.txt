i'm embed youtub video in a node-webkit frameless app, whenev the youtub link insid the video is clicked, the expect behavior is to open the url in the default browser, but what it doe is to creat a new node-webkit frameless window that is on top of my app. iv' tri overrid window.open but this doe not help as flash is probabl use some other api to launch a new window, what i'm look for is a way to either disabl new window altogeth or, to be abl to intercept whenev a new window is open and to redirect the url to the default browser.i look trough the api and it seem that javascript is not expos to the browser process which has all the window instances. ani idea on how to solv this issue?edit: ok so there is a way to disabl flash call
