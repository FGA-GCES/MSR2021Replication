so i'm develop a nativ osx/window app use atom-shel and angularjs. i'm tri to open a file save dialog.atom-shel has a "dialog" api:https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.mdi can use this api from my atom-shel setup js file (main.js):and downloadclientscsv() generat a csv file, and should pop open a file save dialog. i'v tri use the "hidden input element, click()" method, and also tri the "window.open(data...)" method, which work in a web app environment, but atom-shel doesn't like it - just open a blank browser window.ideas?
