where i am currently:i have began work on a nodej nativ extens i intend to work with electron, but from previous work i have note that the build step for build for just nodej are as expected, includ the librari as per instruct and chang to output a .dll file with a .node extension.th problem i am facing:when compil my extension, which tri and test within nodejs, doe not work within an electron contain instanc of nodej - from search around i understand this to be a problem with the header file which i am compil against etc. the document for build with visual studio (not visual studio code) is veri spars and everywher general point to use node-gyp - which is someth i'm attempt to avoid and build use pure visual studio 2015.for reference, when run the work (in nodejs) nativeextens i get the follow error (which googl brought me to the conclus i am compil against the wrong thing):could someon pleas shed some light on where i may be go wrong? i am a novic when it come to c++ program structur and compil methodologies.
