recent my workplac has been transit over from circleci to azur pipelines, and as such we have been migrat all of our ci. while most have been somewhat straight forward, this particular pipelin requir run our linux job insid of a docker image. here is what was in circleci:error. but to instal sudo i need to be abl to run apt-get instal sudo -y'thi caus a circular cycl of not be abl to proceed. how can i get the apt-get command to run insid the azur pipelines? i should note that the mac version of this ran without requir ani modif or need the docker image.
