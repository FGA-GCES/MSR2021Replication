i use an electron app that need to send it activ ip address (in a lan) to my server for ongo communication. for that i use a brilliant script i found here which work great:th problem i have is: if this client is connect to more then one network (sometim the user connect to a wifi as well to have internet), i cannot tell which one is my lan and which belong to the wifi. as i have no control over the use wifi i cannot tell them apart by their ip-range. is there a way to tell (in node or electron) if an network interfac belong to cabl or wifi?
