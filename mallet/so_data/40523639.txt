i'm give it a go at make an ember electron app and want to save some model data to a json or json-api format file instead of push it to a remot api, what would be the best way to do this?i see that it is possibl to call .tojson() on model object to get a basic json represent of the model, from which i can save it to disk use electron-settings, howev i'm at a loss on how to load the data in.from what i can see, use the "push" function in ember data allow you to import data, howev it seem it expect json-api format instead:https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.9.0/models/pushing-records-into-the-store/
