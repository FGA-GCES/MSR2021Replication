i'm creat an electron app with the html5 notif api and would like to have each notif display sever option to the user when she close the notif like so:aft read the mdn document for a notif constructor, i couldn't figur out a way to configur the notif in such a way that it come with sever option ("install" and "later" option in the abov example) for close it.th constructor) seem promis but the lack of document on the "notificationaction" object make it hard to understand how to go about implement this feature.from the mdn documentation: actions: an array of notificationact repres the action avail to the user when the notif is presented. these are option the user can choos among in order to act on the action within the context of the notif itself. the action name is sent to the servic worker notif handler to let it know the action was select by the user.curr i onli have one option ("close") when close a notification.ani suggest will be appreciated.
