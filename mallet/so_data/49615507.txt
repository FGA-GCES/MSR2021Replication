i am tri to build an electron app to open a termin emul (use xterm.js) and insid that to run r.alreadi found this veri use example, and abl to automat run r. but sinc the electron user interfac will have menus and dialog (includ a data viewer), it is mandatori to:detect when new object have been creat in the r environmentreturn (for instanc a new data frame) to the electron app in order to display iti am think to have a set of background r function to report all of that, howev i don't know if:it is possibl to send an invis command to xterm (which will have an activ r session)th electron app can receiv (invisible) messag from xterm (more specifically, from the r process that is open within xterm)al this communic between the electron app and the r session within xterm should not be echo in the terminal, of course. it should be somewhat similar to rstudio, where the new r object are automat report from the consol to the user interface.ani suggest would be high appreciated.
