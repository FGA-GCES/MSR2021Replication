this seem relat to babel: unknown option: base.children, but the fix provid there don't help my situation. two day ago i had an electron applic that ran in develop mode (via electron-forg start') and as a packag applic (start the execut in the folder produc by electron-forg package'). the app continu to run in development, and it will execut in production, but babel produc an error in the web console: this occur on the first requir statement call for one of my jsx file (there anoth thing: react-forg doesn't transpil the jsx, and i suspect i'm about to be told to rtfm over that matter). i can get the same error to pop up whenev i want; all i have to do is enter "require('somefile.jsx')" in the console, and it'll do the same thing. investig of the error reveal that the option manag mergeopt function is pass a copi of react at one point dure the loop that suppos to incorpor the preset and plugins. again, this did not start happen after a chang to the applic code; i tri to updat some packag in npm, and the next build i did produc this error.i'v wipe the node_modul directori complet and run a fresh npm instal follow by electron-rebuild and a repackag of the app produc the same results. i'v tri incorpor the .babelrc content in package.json accord to the doc at the babel website. again, dev work fine and product fails. creat a compliant .compilerc produc similar dispar results. how is my product app get a react compon where it should have the babel options?
