i need to support a special releas per user (or group), and i want each user will auto-upd to a new avail releas onli if it suitabl for him (bi some kind of logic in the backend).i'v tri to do so by use electron-build electron-updat module, and also by use electron autoupdat built in module, but it seem that both alway fetch the latest version when call .i'v seen that when deploy my own updat server, some of them (such as nuts) support a download url for a specif version.a describ use nut specif version for detect platform: http://download.myapp.com/download/1.1.0but there seem to be no support to request a specif version in the app itself use autoupdater.summar all this up: how can i achiev auto-upd to a specif releas other than latest?
