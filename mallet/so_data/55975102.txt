is there a way to fake the document.visibilityst on an electron app? i need that for a websit that doesn't correct deal with loos focus (it onli look at document.visibilityst and should be look at blur also).minim the window works, but is not convenient.edit: my use case is: i'm wrap a websit in an electron app. that websit is look at document.visibilityst to know if the user is activ or not. the problem is that if the user switch to anoth window, the visibilityst is still "visible". the site should also be look at the blur/focus events, but it is not (it is not my website). i would like to handl the blur event myself (which i can), and fake the document.visibilityst so know that it is not visibl or focused.
