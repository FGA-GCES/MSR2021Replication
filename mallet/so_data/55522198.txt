i have an electron app that oper on json data, and the json data has schema files. the data is serv up to my electron app via python flask, and the electron app display it and allow edit it (in an abstract of json). i want to enabl show valid of the field in the electron app.w wrote the schema in vscode and so they all have $schema key and use mani $ref to other schema files.i'v found librair like avj which seem interesting, but then foundhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-json-languageserverhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-json-languageservicewhich seem realli useful. i would like to be abl to use the same json valid that vscode use in my electron app. it not clear to me how to use these packag however. i feel like it would be feasibl to use the languageservic and construct a servic to call dovalidation() on, but it not clear how i would accomplish this with the api.
