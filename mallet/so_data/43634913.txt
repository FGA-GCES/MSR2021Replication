somehow i get a problem, if i call an applic twice or sever time but onli one instanc should be run (which is desired).first some (probabl necessary) background information:work on mac os x el capitan (10.11.6)i'v got an applic made by node.js, electron and build by "npm build -m" (let call it app.app)i instal the applic app.app into program-fold by open the built dmg-file and move it into the program-folderthen i start the applic app.app by click on the app.app-icon in program-folderth applic start with a visibl window and also has an hidden background process runningif i close the visibl window, the app.app-icon remain in the dock (which is okay, sinc the background-process is still running)now (and this is the differ to the window build and run in windows), if i click again on the app.app-icon in the program-folder, i onli get a focus on the alreadi run applic instead of open the window and close the old applic (i can see te focus switch/activ by the switch menu name besid the apple-logo on top of the screen; it becom "app")th close of the previous run instanc is defin in electron code in the init-method as follows: doe not give an output to terminal, it just open the call wherea the direct call doe not throw an error and everyth work fine.anyway, i believ it more a mac os x problem than an app.app-problem.hop there somebodi with same problem and a solut for medon't hesit to ask for more details, if needed.
