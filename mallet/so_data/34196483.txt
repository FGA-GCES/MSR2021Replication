i'm develop a desktop applic base on electron and i use electron-packag to creat executables. the app use some binari node modul such as .on my mac, i packag the app, target both osx and windows. the result packag run fine on osx. but when i run the result window packag (.ex and dependencies) on window 8.1 64 bits, the app throw an error (quit expectedly):i there ani practic or tool that help me be abl to do the packag onc in ani os, even if the app depend on binari modules, and produc execut for windows, osx and linux? for example, i'd like to run the build on osx to produc execut for all three oper systems, instead of have to repeat the packag for each platform
