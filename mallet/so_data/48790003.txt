use electron-forg to build a desktop app. the app is built for both osx &amp; windows. insid my package.json, i have: when i build on windows, i'm have to manual chang the icon in package.json from "app_icon_osx.icns" to "app_icon_win.ico". if i tri to just use "app_icon.png" for both platforms, the icon doesn't show on osx, and the build fail with "rcedit.ex fail with exit code 1. fatal error: unabl to set icon" on windows.i have all 3 version of the icon (icns, ico, png) in a folder in the project. becaus i'm use electron-forge, i don't seem to be abl to use electron packag --icon argument.i there a way i can pass the icon to use as a command line arg, instead of hardcod in package.json? or a way i can use the same png for both platforms?
