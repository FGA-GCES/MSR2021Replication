as most peopl know, postman is made in electron. however, it doe not run into cor issu when attempt to make api calls. if a normal user packag a simpl electron app that made api call use fetch/xhr however, they will be block by endpoint that have a cor policy. my question is, how doe postman get around this, and is there a set or flag in electron that let my own app do the same? i read here and here that "postman is a dev tool" but that isn't a in depth response, sinc postman is an electron app that would theoret be run in chromium (aka a browser). i'd appreci anyon who could provid some headway in this topic!
