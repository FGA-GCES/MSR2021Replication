i have two separ script in my package.json, one run electron (npm run electron) and one run the webpack build and watch commands. i'v tri run both from the same script command like this:thi caus electron to execute, but the second command doesn't fire until electron close which is not desirable. i'v also tri switch the commands, which caus webpack to run in watch mode, and never launch electron. i realiz i could just open two command window and run them separately, but i was wonder if there was a conveni way to run from a singl command in the package.json file.
