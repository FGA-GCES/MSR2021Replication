use casei'v got an exist project develop in c# use winform with custom control for the gui. we are amaz by the approach to write gui use html/css/js and we are look for the best way to write a gui for our desktop applic use the abov mention languages. we onli need to support window devices.mi worries:it doesn't take long to come across recommend use electron-edge. while i am not so worri to get everyth working, i am worri about:debug my c# code (i still want to be abl to start my whole applic right from vs and debug it look i am use to it). i read that i would need to attach to the node.j applic in order to debug my c# code afterwards. sinc the whole program languag is written in c# that sound like a pain?a far as i got edg will let it run as just one process. can i consid the electron applic as an own thread which would still run while my c# code is stuck somewhere?mi option:i am still posit i want to write my desktop gui with html/css/js. what i consid instead of use electron-edg is write an own electron applic which doe communic with my c# backend use name pipes. i wonder if there are larger roadblock whi i wouldn't want to do this and use electron-edg instead?mi question:i would like to get feedback for my two concern mention abov and i also would like to get input about my option to creat the gui as own electron process, so that i have two process (gui+backend) when someon run my application.
