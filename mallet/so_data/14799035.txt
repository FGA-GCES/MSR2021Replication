i'm develop simpl node-webkit applic for window (vista, 7, â€¦) and i need to use some winapi functions, specifically, , to bind system-wid hotkey and make keystrok base on that. there no such api suppli by node-webkit, so i thought to use node-ffi to call that functions.i'm new to winapi development, so i'v read some msdn manuals, but found that most of exampl creat window, messag loop, messag handl procedur and so on. so i don't understand quit well, how to implement correct call to winapi from node-webkit, without creat separ window? node-ffi tutori doesn't cover that case, so i'v found the node window library, but it seem that it just implement window applic by mean of node.i there a way to implement nativ call without creat window application? what the correct way to do that?
