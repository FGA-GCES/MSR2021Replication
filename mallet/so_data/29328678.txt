i'm tri to creat an open sourc app, which will work on browser and offlin as a desktop applic on linux, window and mac. on the browser app i have no problem. the desktop app is more problemat to me, sinc i'm no expert. help me understand if i got this correctly:windows, offlin desktop applic scenario:1) user download .ex package. in this scenario it will tri to instal node.js, meteor and all relat dependencies2) nw.js applic starts. it ask the user if he either has an onlin server to point him to, or start itself a meteor server, and load localhost url. in nw.js app.3) now everyth is the same for offlin and onlin users. onlin user will connect to the server, offlin user will still connect to the server, except that it run on localhost.am i get this right?
