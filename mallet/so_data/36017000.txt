environmentnw.j v0.12.3 io.j v1.2.0 32 bitswindow 8webchimera.j (player) the follow code work but i'm left wonder if it the best approach. the requir is to get the length of each video that in the playlist. to do that i use the event onplay and onpaused. at first i tri do all the code in the event onplay but the app alway crash with no error. after check chimera_player.state() it seem that even after do chimera_player.pause() the state didn't chang while insid the onplay event. i figur have state play and tri to do chimera_player.next() caus the exception. this way seem a bit hacky, but i can't think of anoth one.
