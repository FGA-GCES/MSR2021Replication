i am build an electron app with an angular frontend which monitor the activ window on the comput to track the user activities. howev i am have difficulti figur out how to proper persist this data.i have been do a lot of research and seen peopl suggest indexeddb/dexie.js, localforage, couchdb, sqlite etc. but i am struggl to actual make a decis on which technolog to use becaus i cannot comprehend how to actual implement them in my electron applic - and the document of actual electron implement is veri sparse.i think the reason that i am struggl so much, is that there might some key concept to creat an electron app that i am not understand properly.i think i might be wrong in make the distinct that the main.t (electron) is backend and my angular applic is front end, where i instead should consid it as a whole. mayb someon could elabor on this?thi thought has kept me away from use someth like couchdb where the boilerpl would look like this (place in index.html -> frontend):h from my understand i should be persist the data from the poll function which is locat in what i consid the backend, which doe not align with my understand of the persist librari list above.i expect to be abl to store each window log as a separ entri and do some queri and categor of the data.so i hope ani of you can shed some light on what i am misunderstanding, or suggest a librari which would fit my purpose.
