folks:i'm creat an app use node webkit. the purpos of this app is to display imag and pdfs. the app need to download those file from a central repository, and cach them locally. when the app run offline, the file should still be available, and displayed.on the face of it, this sound like appcach is the answer - and that inde is where i was head when this was a pure webapp in a browser. however, now i'v discov node-webkit, and here we are.node-webkit github wiki states:"however, applic cach is design for browser use, for app use node-webkit, it less use than the other two method, read html5 applic cach if you want to use it."but doesn't say why.i'v also research node.j filesystem - but that seem like a whole magnitud of complex abov what i need.can anyon point me in a sensibl direction?thanks.
