i have an electron app which work fine as a singl application. i use pubsub-j to push messag from compon for other bit of the ui to handl without be tight coupled. i use an mvvm framework so i use this event system to communic between view compon without them all be link to each other, i do use ipc event for some electron messag but general i just use that for low level events, and pubsub for view level event for onli view compon to listen for.now the problem seem to aris when i want to support multipl windows, as for exampl if i go and tri to save on window 1, it seem to actual run the save on window 2, as well as notif from window 1 end up on window 2, so it seem to share some sort of state across applications.also anoth problem i just noticed, if i were to creat window 2 from window 1, then i were to close window 2, the nativ menu bar in window 1 stop function and just throw exceptions.so what exact get share between multipl electron window and what is the best practic for isol this sort of behaviour?
