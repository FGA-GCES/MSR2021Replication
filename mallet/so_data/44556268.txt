i am tri to write a small app with electron that need a database. current i'm test pouchdb, but that shouldn't realli matter.for better code qualiti i creat a class that is go to handl the common databas request - it should be the onli way to access the db.not sure, if i understood the main/render process concept correctly, but i think the main process should take care about db access. so this is my current configuration:main.jsmi question: is this a feasibl solut for code structur or am i get someth complet wrong? my js experi are just use some jqueri effect and node experi is miss completely. this is just a small hobbi project, so i just want to start code ;)
