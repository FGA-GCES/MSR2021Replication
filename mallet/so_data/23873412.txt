this has long been a question of mine sinc i got my hand on angularjs.yes, angularj offer a thorough separ between the present and the undermin logic. however, i find myself in such a dilemma where sometim i realli can't resist the temptat to manipul some dom element direct from my service, which is obvious not best practic becaus angularj recommend do it in directives, which i find quit exhausting, especi in situat where i would like to creat app with an immers experience.rec i'm engag in a nativ app project use node-webkit. we want to build a multi-docu app with html5 and node.js, take advantag of angularjs. but i cannot figur out a way of achiev this. as far as i'm concerned, even nest view are neither easi to creat nor recommend with angularjs, let alon multi-windows. in the meanwhile, i find backbon quit satisfi in this respective. however, i still prefer angularj for other reasons.so what do you think? is there ani solut to this problem? is there ani open-sourc project out there? code exampl are also great appreciated. thx in advance.
