i'v written a basic node-webkit application, and i also have a separ web application. i would like to be abl to pass inform to the node-webkit applic from the web applic directly, but from what i can tell so far this has not been done.i look into use cors, but this will not work when point outsid of a web browser (i tri to point it at a file url [file://blahblah/blah] on the host machine). i realiz that i could just run a webserv within the node-webkit applic to listen for call from the web application, but it doesn't seem like good practic to have an applic accept request over localhost...even if i chose some obscur port to use. this is a veri new area of develop for me, so i have been look everi which way for a reason solut to this problem. at the moment the onli idea i have would be to creat a small nativ osx applic to wrap around the node-webkit application. osx applic are capabl of use custom url schemes, so this shouldn't be a problem. i would great appreci ani suggest from the community. thank for reading.
