when i run i get an .asar archiv which contain the origin .ts file of my project. now to achiev at least some form of secur i would like to add uglifyj to that process so in the end i still have an .asar archiv which now contain uglifyd .js code. how can i do that?pleas be as specif as you can in your answer sinc i have veri littl knownledg about that topic. for exampl i know that electron-forg is expand use plugins. so i guess i could achiev what i am look for by includ webpack in electron-forg and then webpack would use uglifyj to take care of the uglyfi process. howev i dont even know where to start to get that to work.also if you know of ani onlin articl explainig a solut to that problem i would be more than happi to read through it.
