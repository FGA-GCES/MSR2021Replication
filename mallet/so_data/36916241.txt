i am work on a slide show editor with a slide-preview strip. i am use electron and react. each of my slide consist of a background canva for images/text and a foreground canva for drawing. my draw perform is good until i have ~20 slide in my preview strip, then draw slow down terribly. i am draw on mous move event so the user see it trail their cursor.i think i have narrow down my problem to the ctx.stroke() line when i am draw on the preview slide. the preview slide is much smaller but has the same resolut as the main canva the user is actual draw on.i there ani way to make this more perform when have >40 canvas on the screen?
