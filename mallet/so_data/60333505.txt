i was research a bit and so far onli found resourc about templat imag but not a definit guide. i'm build an electron app (electron 8.0). i do have custom icon for dark as well as regular mode.i know that i can provid high-dpi icon like this:tray_icon.pngtray_icon@2.pngit similar within the file for the dock icon. i was wonder whether i can do the same for dark vs. regular mode icons.how do i need to prepare/nam my icon so that maco catalina pick up differ icon for the tray as well as the dock whether it is run on regular or on dark mode?do i need to implement some logic to switch the icon programmatically? how would such logic be execut when my electron app isn't run but the theme is switched?
