i'v been work for a few day on an electron application. when i was done work for the day yesterday, the program was work and run just fine. i came in this morn to start work on it again, and now all of a sudden partway through the program it just whitescreen now. i have not chang anyth from the time of work on it last (last known working) to current time.i do not see ani error be log to the powershel consol after run weird enough, this is one of the first piec of code that i had written in this page of the application, and it has work until just today.i just found out that if i plug in some speakers, the program no longer whitescreens. but this isn't realli a good fix, becaus this program will be ran on hundr of comput a day that may or may not have speakers.
