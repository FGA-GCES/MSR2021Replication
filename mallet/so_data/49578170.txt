i have a music player built with electron.i am have some perform / process block that i didn't expect. i am tri to do some background process for heavi io operations. (determin song durat and album covers)i am do this by call method through the electron.remot module.i have notic that the app didn't do these thing asynchron somehow.i have been run the perform tool to check and saw the click handler take a huge time.dig deeper i found that so, i guess the simpl question here is, what am i do wrong caus these block processes?
