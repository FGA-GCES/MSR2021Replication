i'v been research for long time but haven't found what i need. mayb here someon can help me out.what i want:i'm tri to creat an applic that will run insid electron. both frontend and backend should be encapsul within a singl executable, so i was think react js and nodej would be a good option.but it not as simpl as i thought. found a good boilerplac for reactj https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerpl but i have no idea how i could encapsul nodej as a backend to it.it'd also somehow would need to be integr with the releas packag and so on...addit i'd need to have a webserv that will run on localhost:[port] when you launch the application.techn summary:so basically:electron with react js - as the applic face'nodej - as the backend of the applicationwebserv run local - (use react js).in the application, i would put link to the page that is serv by that local run reactj web app.hop i was clear. and i realli hope someon can help me out.thanks!!!
