i have setup a electron.j + angular 8 applic and it work well but i have the next issue:i have a mediarecord to record with the webcam, and it work well befor 15 minut of recording. when i tri to save the stream to a file in the file system and the stream is less than 15 minut then the file is save properly. when i tri to save it and it is more than 15 then i got a blank page.i tri to handl the stream with pipe and it did not works. i'd like to think it is not a time restrict and i assum it is a size limitation. also, the app is run with angular.then, if there is no a file on the disk, then i cannot upload it with the app.ani clue?
