i am attempt to perform a token request to my ident server by post the detail to my exist service. upon reach the on window and mac this request is sent and resolv within 300ms which is expected. however, on linux (test on mint 19.1 nativ and ubuntu 18.04 vm), this request stall (not sent to the service, check via debug attach on the server side) for up to one minute. the time seem arbitrary, sometim it veri long, sometim onli ten or so seconds.onc the messag is sent the auth servic it is process and respond within 100ms or so, and the rest of the code continu process in a speedi manner.i cannot figur out whi this would onli occur on linux and not anyth else. i have tri search the issu list for axio but i can't see anything. i was wonder if it were an os setup problem, or someth i can configur within axio that i'v forgotten.
