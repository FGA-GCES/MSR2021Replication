when i run the app on windows, i get a spin loader for 1-2 sec. and then noth happens. the app, when run properly, show an icon in the task bar and open a browser window for the user to login.i'm use electron-log, but noth is print to the logs. it seem like the app is die befor it can start. i'm look through event viewer and don't see anyth obvious. i feel like i'm miss someth and don't have a great way to understand what happening.ani suggest on where to look on window 10 to understand whi an electron app isn't do anything?
