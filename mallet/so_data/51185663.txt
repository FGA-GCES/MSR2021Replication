i have creat an electron app which is packag into an nsis instal with electron-builder.now i would like to add a custom text field to the installer, where the user can input a valu (the valu should be save to disk/registry, it need to be avail in the app later).i saw there is a macro defin in the installer, which could probabl be (mis)us for this purpose? but how would i creat a macro which creat a complet page? nsis is complet new to me, and the exampl on the nsis page seem to be for standalon installers, not for hook into an exist installer. or is there another, better approach?
