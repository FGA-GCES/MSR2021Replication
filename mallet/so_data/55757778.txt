i'm work on a real-tim imag recognit project with javascript. yeah, wrong languag mani might complain, but i love js and like some of the gpu acceler machin learn librari and capabl avail for it. i'v develop pretti power imag recognit that almost fast enough to run in real time, but even on a veri high perform gpu, one card alon just isn't up for the task, i need about twice the speed, so i'm think a solut could be to have two separ window util two differ gpus each do half the work in parallel, and communic the result to the primari window to display the result of the process to the user.i know with differ applic in windows, i'm abl to easili select which gpu i want the window to utilize. i'v use wrapper such as electron in the past (although i'm open to ani similar system), and am think perhap it would be possibl to run two instanc of an electron wrapper, each use a differ gpu, and have them communicate, but i'm not actual sure it possibl to have one window talk to the other to communic result efficiently, with low latenc communication.i'm sure there are a wide varieti of way to communic between two applic with the window os, but find a solut that work with a web page wrapper such as electron (or anyth similar) and doe so in a veri low latenc manner is a far less trivial problem.i it possibl to run wrap web page window that can util separ gpus (mean window has to consid them separ applications) and communic efficiently? if so, what are some option for do this, and transfer ani (not all) of the follow data type with low latenc expense?stringsintegersfloatsarraysobjectsi suppos a local socket server could do the trick, but that might be overkil and perhap less effici than better solutions.
