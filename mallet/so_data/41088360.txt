i use webpack to bundl my react app, it emit static file like the index.html, app.js, vendors.j and resourc files. then i simpli throw them to a nginx server, and it works. now i just start play with electron, and i can start a dev server for the app and then start electron, so it works. but i'm wonder how do i make it to product and packag it. do i also need a server to run my app? like have a naught server to support my app in the electron environment...than what if the server is down, i don't think that the solution. however, if i simpli throw the static file into the electron environment, it read the js files, but doesn't run it.
