we just finish build an electron applic with node and react. the applic is run smooth on everi platform and we are pretti happi of the result. now we receiv the request to distribut a version of that app on dvd (mean that we need to run the applic direct from the disc without instal it on the local drive) so we just burn it and tri to launch it.th app is work fine but the problem is the load time as it take almost 2 minut to have the app run without ani feedback to the end user.thi is caus by the overhead for load a larg number of file which is veri slow from the optic drive.so we need some idea to speed up thing or at least to have someth to show to the user dure the load time. this could be a launcher applic with a splash screen but it must run on mac, win and linux.w thought at qt, but we'd like someth less complicated..ani idea are welcom
