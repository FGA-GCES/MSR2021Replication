i have an electron app which contain a canvas. i read 1280x720p video frame from the array and use webgl to display it sequenti on the canvas.everyth work fine on a 60hz display. when i move the app to extern display run at 30hz (refresh rate of 30), thing slow down considerably. i have a css anim on top of canvas. if i remov that css animation, thing look good again.i am reli on requestanimationfram callback to invok webgl draw. from my understanding, on 30hz monitor requestanimationfram callback should get invok 30 time everi second. so i expect draw to work at 30 fps. but each draw oper is take around 120 ms. due to this, draw fps drop to mere 12-13 fps.i suspect some sort of interfer in render due to presenc of continu css anim (it a fade icon) on a 30hz display.can somebodi provid some insight on it.thank in advanc !
