i'v a problem with electron where the app goe blank. i.e. it becom a white screen. if i open the dev tool it display the follow message.in activitymonitor i can see the number of electron helper process drop from 3 to 2 when this happens. plus it seem i'm not the onli person to come across it. e.g.fac &quot;devtool was disconnect from the page. onc page is reloaded, devtool will automat reconnect.&quot;electron die without ani information, what now?but i'v yet to find an answer that helps. in scenario where electron crash are there ani good approach to identifi the problem?for context i'm load an sdk into electron. origin i was use browserifi to packag it which work fine. but i want to move to the sdks npm release. this version seem to have introduc the problem (though the code should be the same).
