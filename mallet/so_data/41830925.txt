everi (c/x)srf protect implement across the web, which i have seen is done by follow flow:serv instati cooki with token on the client side,cli send x-xsrf-token header with valu read from cookie.i it secur to implement point 1 different? instead send cookie, send token in server respons (for exampl header)?whi i want to implement that this way is that my rest api is use by two applications:singl page applic - written in angular 2 and nativ app - written in electron (also angolar 2 is used)brows app is host under same url, as api, so there is no problem to retriev cooki value. but with electron (native) app i have run into issue, when tri to access cooki valu (it is impossible, becaus cooki is set by differ host, then app is run on - by default electron app is run from origin for osx ie).th other way of resolv this problem, could be send cookie, instead x-xsrf-token header. which approach would be better? or mayb there is some differ way to protect against csrf with nativ appps: all my request are done after authent process and contain baerer token.
