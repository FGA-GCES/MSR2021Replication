i have an aurelia applic run in electron. my sourc file are typescript and i have ambient type for electron and node. becaus i know i'm compil for use on electron, i am transpil my typescript to es6 and with system modul loading; this mean i can turn system.j transpil off. i'm use system.j and jspm becaus that is approach aurelia has been pushing. so in my ts files: i would like to be abl to do: in the header, system.j interfer with it and it fail to load. you can place that require('electron') within a class or function and it will work, but i don't find this ideal.question: how can i get system.j to correct return the electron modul that is onli avail when you run the app in electron itself?
