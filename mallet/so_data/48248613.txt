i'v develop an app base on nodej with electron for a web agenc and tri to extend it to the touch bar function of the macbook pro.develop launch the app once, which then automat start various process in the background, such as compil sass files, optim images, etc.typically, these develop work with program such as sublimetext or atom. however, it often happen that the app expect user input dure program or insert hint to optim the code. i would like to display these thing in the touch bar so that the user doe not have to switch between the app dure programming. unfortunately, the touch bar view of my app is hidden when switch to sublimetext or anoth app and replac by the current app in the foreground.i there a way to display an app specif touch bar while the app is run (even hidden) perman without replac it? i wonder if that is at least nativ possible?i couldn't find ani inform about this on the electron documentari or somewher elseâ€¦thank you in advance!
