this is kind of confusing. i need this becaus i am use node.j (node-webkit) in local, there is no php to wait for a response. just javascript code and files.i want to do an ajax call with paramet (i did not think yet about get or post parameters) to a "url" of a javascript file.i do not want the .js code, i want to call it like a .php, wait for a respons (that is actual a json respons format)jqueri has .getscript which copi all the code and run it, but i can't send parameters, and i can't load the whole file everytim i need the response.it is hard to explain this so i make an example.thi is an ajax call:i want the same behaviour, but call .js files, where i catch the get or post paramet (dont know also how yet), make some proccess and give a json answer.i hope i explain myself, and if this is not possible, give me some advic to do asynchron call with parameters.
