i am write my first electron/angular/requirej singl page desktop app. i start with the electron-boilerpl and it work great. however, i need to add angularj to the equation--th boiler plate alreadi use requirejs. i'v tri a number of solut but i either get errors, or depend not be executed. so i tri to implement the simpl exampl from a previous stack overflow question, "simpl requirej with angularj - angular is not defined". however, what i see is that the file are be parsed, but it never execut the code inside. it almost like one or more of the depend are not met so they do not execute. my file are as follows--i have ad some log so i can easili see the execut path.app.html -- the start point that includ requirejs.th result output is still the same as my origin output above. boostrap.j and require_config.j are processed. the bootstrap.j define/funct is never call and app.j is never parsed.
