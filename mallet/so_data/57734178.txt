is it possibl with electron to load a typescript file direct without have to use in fact, while look around, i found this: https://github.com/basarat/typescript-scripthowever, i couldn't make this work in electron so far. perhap becaus i need to tweak the content secur polici somehow? and if yes, how? or chang someth else?and yes, i know it might be ineffici for larger project to do this, but for my usecase, compil on the fli is okay becaus the project is small and i just want to do fast prototyp without the complic of an ad compil step.
