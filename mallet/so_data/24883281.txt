backgroundi am tri to write an applic with nodewebkit. this applic has two parts. first is the service, which will be instal on the user machine, this servic will run on boot and watch a directori for changes.second is the gui client, this will be the client that will specifi which directori to watch. so i was think that the gui client will save a file of the list of the directori specifi to be watch and the servic will look at that file to know which directori he is go to watch.th idea is that the when the user instal the client gui app, it will also instal the servic and run that service.questioni also need to support cross-platform.how do i know where to save my set file in osx and windows?should i refactor the architecture?
