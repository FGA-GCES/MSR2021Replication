my goal is to make an electron application, which synchron client folder with server. to explain it more clearly:if client doesn't have the file present on the host server, the applic download all of the file from server to client.if client has the files, but some file have been updat on the server, the applic delet onli the outdat file (leav the unmodifi ones) and download the updat files.if a file has been remov from the host server, but is present at client folder, the applic delet the file.simply, the applic has to make sure, that client has exact copi of host server folder. so far, i did this via wget -m, howev frequent wget did not recognize, that some file chang and left client with outdat files. recent i'v heard of zsync-window and webtorr npm package, but i am not sure which approach is right and how to actual accomplish my goal. thank for ani help.
