code reference: https://github.com/aredfox/screencapturerproblem description:her is an electron app with a "mainwindow" that hold a button "start capture". onc click it fire an event to the main process, the main process then launch a new, seperate, "browserwindow" object call capturewindow with it own capture.html and capture.j associated. in capture.js, everi three second a screenshot is made and save to c:\temp\screencap (this is a demo app to illustr a problem, thus i did not make this configur and hard code the path in for now). everi time a captur is made in the crapturewindow it freezes, which i expect it to. but, the mainwindow object freez as well, which i did not expect it to do. how should i handl this, so thati the mainwindow doe not freez when a process is be run in anoth "browserwindow" object? i assum electron browserwindow (or "tabs") had a seper thread?edit 20/12/2016possibl culprit is desktopcapturer.getsources().addendum: found that the issu must be insid the codeblock of the solut though is not cach the result of getmainsourc (aka the "source"), as it will result in the same imag data each time of course. i verifi that by write to file as png, and inde each screenshot then was the exact same, even though enough had chang on the desktop. todo: possibl option is to setup a video stream and save an imag from the stream?
