i'm tri to figur out how to call an electron method from my frontend applic javascript. either the main or render process would do fine for starters, presum i can work through the rest from there.in all the exampl i can find, the render code attach to the frontend element and add an event listener:, but receiv various error and all and all can't seem to make the connection.hop i miss someth simple? what the combin of electron-sid syntax and angular-sid syntax that requir to match these up? thanks(i'm not particular stuck on ngx-electron, but it did seem a nice lib and i'm assum it work well, onc i get past my own block...)
