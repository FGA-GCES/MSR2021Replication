i have an electron app and i chose nedb to store it data. i need to have access to the nedb data file for reason i am not will to discuss. the problem i have is that even though i provid a file name and location, the data file doe not get created. i even search my entir harddriv for the file and could not find it. however, my code access the data store in the databas with no problem, even if i stop the app and start it again. (and i am not talk about the default entri that i creat in my code below, but entri that i add show up after i restart the app, and entri that i remov stay remov after i restart the app. this is behavior consist with a databas save on disk rather than an in-memori database.)her is the relev code. pleas note that this is run in the render process. i am run this app on window 10 onli (for now).bottom line is that i cannot find the actual locat of the databas file ('label.db') anywher on my harddrive, and it certain is not at the expect locat ('c:\users\\appdata\roaming\electron\myapp'). what am i missing? where doe the databas file get stored?on final note: i found a similar question answered: where is nedb file stored?. the answer was that the file is kept in memori becaus of use the webpack dev server. if that is the case, i have a problem. i am use the dev server as well, but i still need to be abl to see the file while under development. the file show up onli in product is just not good enough. (i have not tri to run the code in product mode, to see whether the data file appears, so i cannot confirm that is inde true.)
