i'm tri to get my electron mac app to start at login, but i can't get it to work. i'm implement the start at login function from electron api (https://electronjs.org/docs/all#appsetloginitemsettingssettings-macos-windows) and that part seem to work. i'v push the app to the mac app store and it gone through. i'v download the app, set the app to login through the settings, but when i restart my mac, the app won't open and i get this messag in the console:i'm build my mas build use electron-builder, which lead me to believ it might have someth to do with the build process.do anyon have a suggest as to what it might be about?
