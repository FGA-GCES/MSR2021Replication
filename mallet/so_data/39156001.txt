i'm use electron with javascript and am attempt to access a sqlite db. the output of the db is a list of countries. the target is a simpl ul in a div. the action is call by an onclick event attach to a button on the page.her the issue. technic speaking, i can access the db. however, in the data layer (data.js) i have two option that onli sort of work to popul an array from the db file. the console.log() found in each is simpli for debugging.in option 1, the return element return the array fulli popul with a length of 23 (see option 1 imag below) wherea move the return element out of the db.all function return the array empti on top but popul when expand with a length of 0 (see option 2 image). i think the first option is how the array should look, but becaus the array is contain within the db.all function, it doesn't return anyth for getlocations() in data.js. subsequently, the array in model.j and view.j (code below) remain undefined.if i go with option 2, the array popul down the line (i.e. data, model, and view), but the length remain 0 for all the array becaus they are "empti on top". as such, iter through the array for write to the div fail becaus the length ultim is incorrect at 0.as a side note, if i hard code the countri into the array in data.js, all work fine and the list of countri write to the page. while i can (and need to) get the data from the db file, it seem to caus the issu above. so, it realli all about how data.j is return the array.do anyon have ani suggest on how to proper get the array to popul correct so i can iter through them and write to the page?your help is appreciated!!data.j option 1:
