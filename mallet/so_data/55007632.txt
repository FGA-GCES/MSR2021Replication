i'm tri to test my compani electron built browser https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_brows but am meet a few challeng which i am look for support / guidanc with.aft a fair amount of research, it seem i essenti have two option - use spectron as the test framework or selenium with chromedriver. i found a mean to use a custom binari with selenium by use chrome option and suppli the path to the browser execut and thought i was on to a winner with that but i hit a major issu - i could launch the browser but ani interact i tri (use the "typical" test autom approach i previous learn with selenium java) failed:eg method with differ on screen element and could not get anyth to work.so, i gave up on that approach for the time be - if this had work it would have been ideal as my autom experi lie with selenium java. it ok though, i'm happi to learn new stuff, so i look into spectron.however, i have found the document / blog post around spectron difficult to digest - i am a tester rather than a dev and, while i am technic competent, i found the level of assum knowledg here higher than i current possess. plus, it all seem to be javascript which i have littl knowledg of. (this was whi i was hope to go be abl to go the selenium rout which i am familiar with.)what i want to do is to creat a suit of test independ of the browser codebas where we (qa team) can build eg page object model and associ test cases.ani idea / suggest / guidanc would be most grate receiv as i feel that i am not realli get far at the moment!
