i have an electron app that use vue.js.i ran electron-packag and got a nice look folder. when i run the execut on my own comput it works. the window is displayed, and everyth work great.however, if i run it at ani other winx64 comput it fails.no error is displayed, run through cmd doesn't display anyth and background process are started, but the window doesn't open.so i thought mayb it a depend issue. however, i have both depend installed. i have googl for age but cant find out what the issu is.edit: i found out the nfc-pcsc librari i'm use is the root of my problem.. no idea whi and how to solv it... im gonna dig in a bit further. ani idea wy?
