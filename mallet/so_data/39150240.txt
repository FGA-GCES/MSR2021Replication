i'm interest in use azur function in order to build releas packag for windows. main center around electron/node. specifically, need to be abl to do binari compil of some modul (sqlite3 namely). which mean vc++ build environ + window sdk, python ^2.7, node and related...ha anyon done this via azur functions? i know there are similar question for get nuget packag in an azur function, and it doe seem that there is an option for the c++ tools, but not sure where to even start.th main hope is to do this for less than the cost of a full vm for someth that is like to run less than 2-3 time a month.
