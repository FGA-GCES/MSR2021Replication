i am work to port a wpf applic to more platform and at this moment, electron app is the most well-known and easili to work with compar to others. and i definit awar of the memori hog of electron app sinc it includ the entir chrome engine. not so fond of it, but right now, it is the best choic in term of time and maintainability.basically, the app that is current be work on is just a screenshot captur of the desktop or an applic window and send it over the network. so far, i was abl to replic the same similar function in the electron app compar to the wpf version. however, when monitor the performance, the electron app is use too much memori footprint. the main render process take as much as 200mb ram and mayb more compar to the wpf version, which at most up to 100mb. that doe not includ the other 2 process (main and the gpu process), which in total could more than 400mb-500mb per session. initi at startup, it is at least at the level of the peak wpf version, which i can toler it. however, as the program doe the logic, it continu to consum lot of memory. so far, i was abl to cut down some of that if not use other javascript libraries, just onli the nativ libs.below is the code that doe the logic: could contribut more to that as well.so anyon has ani idea to optim this? are there other way to achiev the same function but with better performance?
