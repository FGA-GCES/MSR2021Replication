i found a similar question here:uncaught typeerror: $(...).select2 is not a functionbut that not for electron (here is anoth question with electron without solution: https://github.com/select2/docs/issues/17), and the solut is to check if jqueri is load twice. how can i check if i'm load jqueri twice?actu i think this is a generic problem for librari in electron when we use "nodeintegration=true" in our window, becaus we need to add some hacks: this is my code: i don't fulli understand what is doing, but seem is check module.exports, which is true in electron window with nodeintegration=tru
