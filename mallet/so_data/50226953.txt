i'm tri to display info from the spotifi api as a overlay for directx and opengl game as there is a lot of peopl ask for it and i need a project for school. i'v got all the design element work in a electron applic and i now just need to make it an overlay.th applic has a coupl states: playing, paused, control (free cursor to allow in game song control with a coupl buttons), connect(for when audio is play via spotifi connect rather then on the host pc) and stopped.if possibl i would also like to have the control state toggl with a key bind.i'v had a look onlin and can't find anyth helpful, but i do know that discord use someth like this. from what i can see, they use c++.edit: pergi comment with this: electron offscreen render which seem good enough.
