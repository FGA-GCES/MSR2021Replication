i'v creat an electron app primarili a web-app, that has minor integr with the electron app. the major is just load a websit through a browserwindow with loadurl.howev for each createwindow spawn (they have the same content), i need variabl to affect the singl window, and not all of the windows.curr if i chang a variabl they are chang for all of the windows. i'm not sure how i would make the variabl onli be updat and usabl with a certain valu in the specif window.e.g. if i set userid = 1 in one window, it also chang in the 2nd window when i'm send an ipc messag through the web app. i'm not sure what would be the best logic here.
