i am a beginn to angular and a complet noob to electron. i was wonder if it would be possibl to port an exist angular app to electron by use most of the exist codebas of the webapp?i found a coupl of link on this but not much on google. most result talk about start with angular and electron to creat a desktop app - which is my intent but i would like to use most of my exist code base and ideal just add webpack and electron relat config to compil the electon app from exist codebas as i don't want to maintain two version of the same codebase. i could use this bridg to access electron api (although i am not sure how it will all hang together)https://github.com/develephant/ngelectronwhat do usual peopl do?
