i'm use electron (both 2.x and 5.0.x tried) along with sequelize/tedi to develop a desktop app, when retriev data from mssql, it alway convert datetim field by ad local timezon offset(for ex. +04:00).the mssql datetim field doesn't includ timezon info, it seem that electron consid it as utc time, how to prevent it? what strang is when i'm use sequelize/tedi without electron, everyth is okay, but in electron no matter what option put into the dialectoptions, it won't work, includ useutc/timezone/typecast/process.env.tz, the one and onli solut that work is to switch my comput timezon to utc.
