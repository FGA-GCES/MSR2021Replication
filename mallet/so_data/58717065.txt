we have a multiplatform applic (web, electron for desktop, io and android apps). when authent through our electron app, some of our user are be forward to a legaci auth rout (https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/approval) rather than the standard auth rout (https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/consent/approval). this legaci auth rout fail to complet author so our user are unabl to log in to our app. onli our electron user are see this. we first saw this on octob 16th, and it becam more frequent around octob 28th.this happen when we open an electron browser window and visit https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth with the standard parameters. if we copi the same url and paramet into a non-electron browser window, we are sent to the standard auth route.her the relev part of our electron oauth code:what happen is that instead of be proper authenticated, the last screen of the oauth consent flow is a white screen with the titl "approv clicked". on web and other platforms, the login finish correctly.
