i'm write an electron app with react. i run the develop version use this command:a you can see requir doe not appear here and all of the import asid from ipcrend are design to run client-side, and therefor should not use required. i tri comment out the ipcrend import but it result in the exact same error.most puzzl of all, i get the exact same error even with the entir index.j file comment out. the consol still claim the block comment contain a refer to require, which is not defined.
