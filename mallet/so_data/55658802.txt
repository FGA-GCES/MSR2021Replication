i start to write a medium size electron app with version 1.x. i want to replac a desktop app i wrote ten year ago use electron. the desktop app had a dockabl main menu (most peopl just dock it on the left side) and from the menu the user could open window with data entri form (and in fact open the same form mani times). each instanc of a form/window was abl do crud and independ of the other form/windows. of cours if the user close the menu it would close the open window (first check if ani data need save – etc..).us electron i was abl to recreat much of the desktop app features. however, i use “window.open” to open and creat the data entri forms. today, i read that in general what i did is a no-no! use window.open(). so if that is true that window.open() is not good practic what do i use to replac it.
