i'm work on an electron application, whose client side is written in angular2. i'm have the classic problem that a lot of peopl have encount (eg. here and here), name that i'm updat my compon data, but the view doesn't get updat becaus angular doesn't know that the data has changed. the solut peopl suggest (see abov and also here) is to manual run chang detection, either on the whole compon tree, or part of it (similar to angular 1 calls, as it slight defeat the purpos of use angular.i'm pretti sure i know whi this happens: i'm creat bluebird promis outsid of angular, in electron code (ie, the main process), and these aren't zone aware, so they don't notifi angular of the changes.i don't know how to solv it, though. what can i do to creat zone awar promis in my electron code, to avoid have to manual run chang detect all the time? can i convert my bluebird promis to zone awar promis somehow?edit: i think i was wrong, bluebird promis aren't zone awar even if creat within angular. they'r just not zone awar in general.edit 2: i was complet wrong in the previous edit. bluebird promis work just fine with zones. however, in the context of an electron application, creat a promis in the main electron process and use it in the render process (where angular lives), doesn't work, as the return promis isn't zone-aware. creat the promis from angular code worked.
