i have a node-webkit app that read imag metadata and i want to creat a drag-and-drop featur to allow the user to drag imag from the desktop or the browser into the app. drag imag from the desktop work fine, but drag imag from the browser into the app caus my node-webkit applic to crash.i comment out all of the code in my .on('drop', ...) handler and it still crashes. further more, if i drop the browser imag anywher on the node-webkit app even if it is outsid the dropzone, it will also crash. i'v also found that if i put a breakpoint on the drop handler and step through the code then it won't crash. i couldn't find anyth on the web about a node-webkit bug relat to this issu but i'd appreci ani inform on how to get around this!edither is my drag-and-drop code:
