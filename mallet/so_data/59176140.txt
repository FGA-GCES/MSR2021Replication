i am investig whether is it possibl (i am sure it is, i mean simpl way) to build a java-bas client desktop app to play drm protect video stream.drm: dash cenc drm1, playready, widevin classic\modular, fairplay.vlcj support the input-from-memori featur to implement custom protocol or drm but it look like a pain dig into drm specifications.ther is a node.j open-sourc project downstream for electron which can help with widevin drm.the articl describ java and electron integr (source) but i guess it is accident complex in this case.previ i didn't face with video-stream domain and i wouldn't like to reinvent the wheel so my question are:it seem that there are no "pure" java implementations. why? becaus of format wars? secur issues?do you happen to know ani simpl way (dalvikvm support widevin out of the box) to creat app without involv "browser techs" like js? thank you. i would appreci hear your thoughts.
