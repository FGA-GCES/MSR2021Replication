i'm make an electron app that i need to be cross-platform.it requir grpc to run. except, to get the grpc for the os, as far as i know, i need to run the npm command from that os.i.e. sinc i'm use a windows, the command will onli get the grpc binari for windows, which is great for run the applic on window - but not for the other oss.on way i thought to get around this problem is by use docker, except, i don't know if it actual possible, and if it is - i don't know how to do so.i thought, if docker is meant to run the applic in an isol environ - could i use it to make npm download the grpc binari for linux &amp; macos?
