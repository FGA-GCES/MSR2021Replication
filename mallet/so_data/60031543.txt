i have a simpl electron applic that queri a sql databas and display the output via an html table. i have everyth work correctly, but now i need to "refresh" the html tabl everi x minut (with the new result of the sql query).right now, i have it work correct use the meta tag direct in the html with: http-equiv="refresh" content="300". this correct refresh the page everi 5 minutes, which is exact what i want.although, the problem is that the refresh caus the screen to go white while the sql queri execut and the html is built. obviously, the better solut would be to use the dom and onli modifi the cell that have actual changed, sinc the last refresh. the problem i am run into, is get "setinterval" to work correctly.... onc again, this is a veri simpl electron application. i am use their start boiler plate. i have tri ad the "setinterval" in the in all cases, it onli fire once...i know this becaus the first line of code in updatetable() output the current date and time to the console, via console.log()..i have tri lower the timeout valu to 10 second (from 300000 to 10000), just so i don't have to wait so long while test and that didn't make ani difference. i suspect the problem i am have has someth to do with my lack of knowledg of the electron framework (like, perhap the differ "processes") and i have been search for solut for two day now, with no luck. ani advic on how i can accomplish this, is much appreciated!
