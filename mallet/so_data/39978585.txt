i am make a html report that has to be auto-gener out of a nativ code application.thi html report can be a bunch of file with html components(js,css..), but this will be use as a report onli and not with a webserver. in this report i need to add mani data tabl and graph where im intend to use lib like d3. here ,1.how do i add and remov data from a browser session without server so that i can load data from the folder to browser to display it asgraph. and clear the data from ram as soon as the page is navigatedout of a chart view (this is a huge data). so ad and clearingth data will help to make the applic responsive.how do i save a file like "user.conf" file that save , say, axi scale factor that user of the report chang as they view thereport. so while he repoen the report with the bunch of file, itcan read the previous set and display it in proper scaling.i found onli two solut for this problem,hta app. - this technolog seem to be deprec and im not sure if it support are new javascript and interact svg from d3. this seem to be a learn and implement in a littl differ direct than actual html development, not abl to judg if this is a worthi tryout.to build a nwjs app - this is a straight forward solution. but when i tri this, a report (to be standalone) come around minimum of 50mb. this make no sens from the applic perspective. to bundl a webkit runtim to a html for everi report make no sense. a work around is to make this nwjs as a one time instal and to open *.nw file (zip file of all web contents) from the report use this tool. this is not eleg as i will request user to instal this packag and on top of it, the portabl of html and not have to instal ani other softwar for view a html is lost.any/al answer for make a html report that can access the file system for save the prefer without a web server concept will be high useful.
