im build a node-webkit app that post a sort of log entri everi few minut to my joomla site. i am quit skeptic of store the username/password in my app.i found two solutions, both allow login via url (simpl get stuff).simpl compon that handl authent via getapi for use extern app and site to communicate/login/regist to a joomla siteboth allow my local node-webkit app to login like so:but the 2nd solut say this: if get success i mean if the info is correct then you will get this information: [{"status":"login successfull","user_id":"982","username":"user","session_key":"1e3fdgdt4454580ae78e2ab90f35856c17f3"}] status user_id usernam session_key you can store all the inform in your app for next time.th questionwould store the session key allow me to login to the websit in the future, even day after the first login? i'v tri search around but can't find an answer on this. or should i store the login credenti with some sort of local encryption. again - this is node-webkit so am not sure on how secur i can store stuff.
