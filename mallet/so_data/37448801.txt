i want to build a cross platform electron app with an embed sqlite database. scala.j would be run on both ui and "backend" of the app, which is an embed node.j server. jvm is not involv in this setup in ani way. so, scala.j will need to talk to said sqlite database.scala has squeryl, slick and a few other librari for talk to sql databas in a type-saf way. those librari don't work in scala.j on node.j becaus they use which is not implement in scala.js.how can i talk to the databas (simpl sqlite is enough) in a type-saf way from scala.js?mi best guess right now is to write a type-saf scala.j facad for some node.j databas access library, perhap use autowire? not sure if that is a good approach, or even possible. ani pointer welcome.
