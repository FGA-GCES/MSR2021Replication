i'm tri to build an angular project where i have 3 file - getcomputers.js, getips.j and one typescript file - app.ts. i need to requir a trendmicro modul in both javascript files. for one file it work but for the other it throw a modul not found error. i ran the follow line to link the trendmicro modul to my project.note: the error show up for index.j which accord to me is mislead becuas the same error doesn't show up when i requir trendmicro modul in getcomputers.j file. the dsm-js-sdk folder contain that module.
