our applic is built with node-webkit and we'd like to add an authent layer.w could use node-webkit as a regular browser and hit our websit (ie redirect to http://www.oursite.com) but we'd loos all the interest of webkit. the point here is to authent the user from the start, ie with the local url which should look like *file:///c:/users/alexan~1/appdata/local/temp/nw7628_20315/index.html*accord to this question, we can use fb authent should work.but is there a way to use oauth? the two solut that came to my mind are:us an ifram insid the page but oauth provid refus such requestscal direct oauth with our local return url (file:///...) but redirect to local file are forbiden too in browser (henc in webkit).it might be a pretti general question but anyth i'm miss with oauth/node-webkit?if it impossible, how would you authent user in such an app?
