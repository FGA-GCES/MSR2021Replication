i am use electronj to creat an applic that generat an stl file from a grayscal image. in such i have some nest loop that go through everi other pixel to write the coordin for each facet to a file. i am tri to implement a progress bar for the process (process a 4k imag can take up to 30 min) by updat the width properti of a div. however, even though i set the new width in the loop, it seem as though the width doe not updat until after the loop have finished. am i updat the style too quickly?sinc i do not includ the rest of the js below, the select file button let the user select a file from their file system (that is an image). the convert button use that file path and opencv to find the "heights" of the pixel of the imag (which is read as grayscale) and to write to an stl file the facet that would come about from connect those "heights".her is my html:
