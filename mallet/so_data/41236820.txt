a littl bit of introduct - the (wannabe) softwar i'm work on is a desktop applic built on github electron. it is design to have two modul - a ui and a backend with an api, the second "living" in a hidden browser window and run on expressjs. the idea is for the ui and the api to communic over http so they could be decoupl if needed. all file are in utf-8.now the problem itself - the main api rout look like:th last thing that came to my mind was actual decoupl the api from electron. when i run it in the termin with node, i actual get the proper result - both in the log messag in the termin and in the json answer in the browser.what am i do wrong and what further debug could i possibl do?
