i had to upgrad my electron packag in order to do dmg build on os x high sierra. ever sinc then i can no longer do squirrel build for windows. i'm abl to build for nsis, but that appear to be 64-bit onli and doe not includ the updat package. i'm use squirrel as we still have a lot of 32-bit client and we suppli auto updat via a squirrel server.it appear there someth incompat between the old iconurl paramet requir by squirrel and the new icon parameter. i'v updat all my packag and the squirrel builder is a compar version to electron builder, yet still no luck. has anyon found a way around this problem?
