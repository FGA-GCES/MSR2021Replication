i am new to electron, but i was think about creat a desktop applic to sell as a saas.th softwar will function primarili in an offlin state, which bring me to my first concern. if the applic is meant to function primarili offline, how doe one go about authent a user to make sure they have paid for the product or that their subscript is valid in the first place? i mean, what is stop somebodi from dig around in the code and "jail breaking" the softwar if it is not expos to onlin authentication?can anybodi explain how authent general work in this context?i there a way to implement foolproof offlin authentication?
