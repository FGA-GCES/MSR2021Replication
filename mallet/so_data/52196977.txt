i'm make an electron app that run a custom script on a websit in the background. this code is be execut in a second window creat by the main window. the second window then creat anoth hidden window where the websit will be load and the custom script will be run. i need to be abl to pass the window id of the second window to the hidden window so when the custom script is finish run it can send an ipc messag back specif to the second window.i found an issu on github where someon answer in 2016 that it appear you could assign custom valu to win and then read them in the newli creat window but i have had no success implement that.when i tri to read win.creatorid it is undefined. how can i identifi the second window from the hidden window so i can send messag to it?
