good day,i am work on a pet project use nodej and electron. it is basic a simpl text editor at the moment. howev i am run into an issu when tri to pass the valu of a text-area to a function prior to save to file.specif when i call a function in anoth module, the valu of the content becom undefined'. i suspect i am pass it incorrectly, or that it is be over-written between when i make the call and when the call executes, sinc string are suppos to be pass by reference.th code for the renderer(index.html) is like this :as mention in the comment, the veri first line of the function log the content of the console, which display the substr as undefined'. thank you for your time and your consideration!// extra context//i have done some search but beyond learn that string are pass by refer and are immutable, i have not seen an answer to a question like this. there has been some discuss of closur issues, but usual in the context of event and callbacks, which i do not believ is the context here.// extra information//i have sinc found a solut to get my paramet to pass correctly. i have post the answer below. i did two things:1. chang the function definit from const to let'2. chang the order of the params, and remov the space follow the comma.
