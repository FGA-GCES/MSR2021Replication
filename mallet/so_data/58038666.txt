i'v been tri to compil my small nativ modul to use with electron 6.0.x but upon simpli run it would generat binari in bin/darwin-x64-73 folder (where i presum 73 stand for node_module_vers 73, electron modul version). yet request it from electron throw an error that modul is compil against node_module_vers 72 (which is what node use as of version 12.10). i'v tri the same procedur on newli configur window machin and everyth work as intended, where the same procedur (with fresh node/electron installs) fail to produc desir output on mac (i'v test it on two differ machin run differ osx/maco versions). i'v mention the issu onc here, but sinc i found that it is uniqu to maco this time (sorri for duplic i guess).
