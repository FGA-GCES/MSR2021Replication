i'm work on a node webkit project (now call nw.js). the latest stabl version of nw (0.12.1) allow the "webview" tag from chrome extens to be integr into a nw project.aft some initi testing, the webview tag seem to work fine for display basic webpages. but it won't display ani flash video embed in a webpage.flash video play just fine outsid of webview (ie in the normal nw browser), as i have "plugin" set to "true" in package.json, therebi use the flash dll instal on my system. they just don't play insid a webview.i just came across an articl here...https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tags/webview#local_resources...which state that "webview are prevent from load ani resourc packag with the app". so i'm guess mayb that is what prevent ani flash dll instal on my system from be use by webview? i'm not quit sure how to fix this though (assum this is even the actual problem). do i need to creat a manifest.json file specif for this, as state in the articl link to above? if so, what exact would i put in there? i'v been use nw for a while, but haven't realli mess around with chrome extens code at all, so that part still a bit fuzzi to me.thanks!
