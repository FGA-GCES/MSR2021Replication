what is the correct(tm) way for an electron applic to run both as a desktop applic and as a service?i have look high and low for this but to no avail. this is how i think it should work.creat a launchd/systemd/window servic descript that:set electron_run_as_nod environ variablerun the packag electron applicationproduc happiness?can the packag electron applic run in this manner access the content of the asar file? if it can, great.then just build and packag two directori with the application. both compil for the abi version electron is on:directori electron_modul with binari modul compil for an execut that report be electrondirectori node_modul with binari modul compil for an execut that report be nodewith the appropri node_path also set in the servic description, i should be all golden.right?
