ok, this may sound as a veri strang question, but nevertheless.what i want is to have a separ browser applic (on mac) with some fix set of tab that will be reset on each start of this app. for example, i use a bunch of web applic for work (gitlab, toggle, forge, etc) and i want to use them separ from other sites, in separ application.can this be achiev with ani browser, or mayb quick built with some sdk or in ani other way?for now the most close thing i'v found is this: http://www.sitepoint.com/tabbed-browser-node-webkit-angularjs/but the approach.. you use a singl webview, fake tab in js and use ifram to display content. it should work, but i wonder, if there is a better way?
