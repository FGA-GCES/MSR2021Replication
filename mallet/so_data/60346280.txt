i'v been play around with the mpr121-shield capacit touch sensor by adafruit. in arduino ide, there is an exampl of code you can simpli download and run, and it work perfect : when i touch on the pin 11, for example, it return '11 touched'', and when i releas it, it return '11 pressed''. great!now the problem come when i tri to transfer that data to nw.js. by use chrome serial port in nw.js, i can connect to the port in which my arduino is connected, and tri to read whichev data the arduino is sending. however, as i tri to read the data, the onli thing i receiv is an arraybuff fill with byte of 0. i am realli not sure what is happen here, as both devic work perfect when i run it in arduino ide, but it return basic noth with chrome.serialport.do anyon have a tip or an idea of what go on here? if i do a console.log(info.data), i onli get an arraybuff with empti bites.thanksher is my code :
