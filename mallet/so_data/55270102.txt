i built a simpl app use electron, electron-forge, and vue.when i run my app via "electron-forg start" it work great.when i tri and compil my app with "electron-forg make" it compiles, but the app itself doe not complet the back end scripts, some promis or return is not resolving. i'v determin the problem is not on the front end (vue) but someth go on with node.i'v been abl to get some debug by set up manual break point in the code and send it to "mainwindow.webcontents.send" and leav the dev consol on in chromium.however, this is realli take shot in the dark. is there ani way to display the node consol from a compil electron app? this would make debug 1000 time easier, but i can't seem to find a solution, all refer are about the chromium debug console, which is not use here.
