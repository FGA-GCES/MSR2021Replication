the question is - how much memori avail to the main process in electron?background:i am build an app, which deal with larg amount of table-lik data, memori usag could be about 500mb, could be more in the future.and there is a requir to save it as xlsx. i can build xlsx on the server (this is not an issue), but i also want to build it on the client side - and this is kind of an issue.in chrome there is around 2gb memori available, and for current use case it is ok - i will have to use mayb around 400mb for xml's, mayb about 100mb for stream xml and zipping, and around 100mb for final xlsx blob. in total 1100mb.but it is possible, that there will be more data in the future. and i will get overflow at some point in chrome.so i figur out, mayb in electron app i can get access to total pc memory? mayb someon has an answer, or point to some doc - i have not found answer yet.if no-on knows, i'll test myself obviously...
