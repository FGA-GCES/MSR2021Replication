i'm tri to integr electron builder with react (create-react-app).curr my react code and my electron code are separ projects, and work fine, but i'd rather integr them proper to speed up the build process.at present, i build the react app, and use a postbuild script to copi the built file to a directori in my electron app. i then build the electron app, point the url to this directory.when i tri integrating, i assum i should set up my script to build the react app first and then build the electron app, again point to the react directory. however, the compil app is twice the size of befor (280mb vs 150mb), and take longer for electron builder to package.i electron builder do some automat magic with react and result in 2 react builds, or someth like that? or is it compil all of the npm modul for react into the electron project, or someth similar? i can't realli work out whi this is happening, but it seem like my understand of the build step is obvious wrong somewhere.thanks!
