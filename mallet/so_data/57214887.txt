i am build a small music player. like ani other player, you can use your keyboard media key (previous song, next song, play, pause) to control it, even if the app doe not have focus.however, when i regist those shortcut so electron can listen for them, other app can't use them. if my app is running, e. g. spotifi or window groov won't do anyth when ani of those key are pressed, becaus my app is alreadi occupi those keys. i am regist the shortcut like this:so my question is: is it possibl to releas those shortcut whenev anoth app request them?if yes, is it possibl to re-regist those shortcut when the other app doesn't need them ani longer? (let assum the other app will unregist the shortcut when no longer needed)
