i was wonder what the best way to go with oauth is when use electron.at first i was do a project that use express, later someon suggest me to take a look into electron-forge, so i start the project with that.problem here came when i read about the problem about make an app that will have my "client-secret" on it.what are my option here? i tri electron-oauth library, and it works, but it use the client-secret.then someon mention i should use appauth (but i think it still use the client-secret) so not sure what differ it would make (i also haven't found javascript exampl for this library) i guess i can alway take a look at the typescript one.also, last question relat to this. i'm tri to author against spotify, but i don't see in ani of their document that you can do it without use a client-secret.well, ani help is appreciated. thank a lot.
