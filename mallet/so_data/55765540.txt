i have an electron app run on my comput (slack). i would like to run some javascript that read html dom of this app. is this possible? if so, is there a "get started" somewhere? in my mind, sinc electron use node.j to host html / javascript, i can possibl read the dom. at the same time, i could see this not be allow becaus it could be a secur risk. i'm ok with the secur risk sinc it run on my machine. so, i assum there would be a uac prompt. still, i'm just tri to figur out how to read the dom from an extern script if possible.thank you
