so, i tri to make electron app to run express as the server and react as client. my step is basic one i think, first i generat electron with electron boilerpl and then insid the project that got generated, i generat express into server folder use boilerpl also, and insid the same electron project folder i generat react with create-react-app into client folder.her is my project folder structure:cli folder from create-react-app, server folder from express boilerplate.in develop i run express at port 30001 and react at port 3000. and use this script to run them :but, from this point i don't know a slight clue of how to build this.note: i have tri anoth react-electron boilerplate, and some just too much for me or some can't import node modul direct to reactj i don't know why. i am use expressj as bridg between my react and node modules. ani insight on better implement would be great appreciated.
