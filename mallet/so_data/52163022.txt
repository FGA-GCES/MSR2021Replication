i'v build a web-app that is display in an electron-app with nativefier. that alreadi work great, but now i need to send request from the websit to the local network to talk with some local devic which are (with it ip-address) configur in the web-app.i had the idea to use the electron-app as a "proxy" to the local network by use a javascript callback from the websit to the electron-app (don't know if this is possible, just an idea), which then make the local request becaus it run on a comput in the same network.th reason for this post is that i need ideas/tip to secur this and prevent allow to talk to other than the desir web-app (avail under a certain domain) by develop someth protect like check or valid the server, valid the request by send it hash back to the server or other methods.so my question are: is it general a good idea to do someth like this or is this a huge secur problem and have anyon ani tip to secur the communic and onli allow the communic to in the web-app configur devic in the local network?
