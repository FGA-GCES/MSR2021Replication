so i have a camera output a udp multicast stream on my local network, and i know it is work correct becaus i can connect to the stream through vlc media player via the mrl "udp://@{multicast_addr}:{port}.i want to write a nodej client that will at least acknowledg that it is receiv these udp packets, but i can't seem to get it right. from other stackoverflow posts, this is what i have so far.when i run this, i get the messag "udp client listen on {local_addr}:{port}" but then no "packet received" messages. can anyon tell me what i'm do wrong? am i misunderstand how a udp multicast stream works?thank you to anyon who can help.edit: okay so i got it to work, but i don't understand how. on the last line, instead of bind (port, host), i bound (port, {multicast_addr}). on run it, my consol flood with "packet received" messag and i'm now even more confus than before. if anyon would care to explain, i would be veri grateful.
