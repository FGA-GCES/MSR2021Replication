this seem realli dumb, but i need help for import some sourc code into the render process in electron:i have an electron app:index.html (load window.j with a tag)- index.js- window.js- useful_functions.jsin flag, but that didn't help eithernote: i'm not tri to import npm modul but my own code, in an other file right next to it.i'm look for examples, but i onli find super small sampl with just the basic files. (or huge app like atom that would take me a while to figur out)i don't have webpack setup for this project yet, but i'm sure there is a simpler way to do this veri basic task...thank for ani help.
