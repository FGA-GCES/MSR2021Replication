recent i made an electron app with nuxt for render process. the app is for a local pizza place, it poll the exist wordpress app endpoint for new order and print new order on a pos printer (bixolon-srp350-plus) whenev there is a new order. the app use built-in electron webcontents.print() method to print a simpl page window which repres the order slip (address, contact info, order specifics, etc). everyth was work fine until one day the printer driver went missing, no idea how. i reinstal the driver and sinc then my print output come out in garbl hieroglyph and the printer beep (incorrect file format i guess). i cannot even print a test page from window control panel.th app is run on win7 32bit, the printer is connect with usb/usb interface.i'v tried: reinstal the driver, chang paper settings, chang font size in my order page to a lower value(it print "fine" with font-size:2px obvious the text was unreadable), in printer properties/advanc i'v tri enabl print direct to printer.also, there was an earlier app written in c# which had a bloat file issu or someth which caus it to crash everi onc in a while. so my guess is that the person who wrote it also set up the printer which made my app work as well, ala i have no way of get hold of that person.mani thank in advance, hope somebodi had some relat issues,cheers!
