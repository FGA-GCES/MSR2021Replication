i'm creat an audio-visu app for perform at clubs/parties. it involv webgl anim that run at 60fps. the anim respond to multipl paramet that could be constant chang everi second (e.g. the size of a spin cube could be puls to music). as an example, there may be 20 parameters, all chang sixti time per second. these paramet are repres in the ui as numbers/visu bars.i'm use react/flux/nwj to do this and it work fine. howev i realli like redux and would like to chang the data flow to the redux model.mi question is:wil updat the store in an immut way (e.g. replic it for each change) affect performance, when it could be chang more than 60 time per second? if so, is there a way i can bypass this for certain part of the app and just use redux for the less frequent chang to the app.
