i want to pull data (mayb scrape) from a web site and save it to an extern file. my first thought was to write a chrome extens to do that for me, but i could not find how to save to an extern file. (i am a newbi with chrome extensions.) i search stackoverflow and found answers:"you can't do that in a chrome extension.", "you can do it, but i'm not go to tell you how. ;)" "use localstorage" localstorag doe not write to a user extern file, and i may need to save mani mb of data. my second thought is to use electron and write a special-purpos browser for the task. electron has node built-in, so save a file is possible.befor i put time and energi into do this, has anyon alreadi tri it? ani pitfal or roadblock ahead?
