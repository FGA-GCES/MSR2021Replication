i want to build node-webkit. i follow the instruct from this site https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/building-node-webkit but the part with the .gclient file didn't work.aft the command the solut i found for this problem was the gclient config http://... command with a link like https://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src or similar ones. but with these link gclient doesn't download the node-webkit stuff.so is there a work link for this problem or a option to download the stuff without gclient?i did it with a fresh instal ubuntu 12.04 in a virtual machin becaus the install-build-deps.sh i have to execut later doe not support my ubuntu 13.10.could the vm be the problem?
