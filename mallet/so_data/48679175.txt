i am new to electron and have fresh start an electron project in our company.us electron the way to creat a modal window is to: set the parent for that new child browser window and by set the modal type to true.thi work well and fine.mi case is, we have so mani modal window that need to be pop up, that is be achiev by make a synchron call from the render to the main, where main.j open up the new modal window. i am pass a variabl call parent from the renderer(: remote.getcurrentwindow()) and in my main on ipcmain i am fetch that parent variabl and set it as the parent of the child window and by set the modal to true, this doesn't seem to work as the more and more window are get call from renderer, the browser window even though set the parent attribut as obtain from the render doesn't act as a modal window, i.e., it get close when the focus is move away. in this case how do i come to know that which is the parent window of this new browser window which is about to open up?how do i overcom this??
