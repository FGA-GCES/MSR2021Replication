solut at the endi am build a angular + electron applic where i want to be abl to drop imag resourc straight into the desktop window, this will trigger a creat flow where i save the imag onto the local filesystem.th basic is up and running, but i'v walk into a tricki situat where it seem like the angular applic lose it sens of state completely. when get a messag from the electron main process, use ipcrender for listen on the messag "url-activated" the code execut seem to get out of phase with the angular execut cycle.in the callback from ipcrender i execut a rout navigation. this is where thing turn weird. the rout navig seem to get stuck somewher in the middle, sometim i get stuck between the current rout and the next, this get solv by interact with the applic (seem like when the angular app execut it chang detect it handl some of the previous execut actions, like switch proper to the next route).th applic at this point is pretti wonky, i need to do addit action to make the app behav and execut previous interact (an exampl is that when i tri to open a select box to see the options, this doe nothing, but when i open the sidenav the select box option appear). it feel like the applic run-tim process has gotten sever out of sync in other words.it feel like it all root back to the ipcrender event, i might not handl it correctly, but i'm at loss to find a good way to go about it. here a code snippet of the current solution:
