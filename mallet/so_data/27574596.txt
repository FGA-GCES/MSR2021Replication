i am write a document read applic use node-webkit. a document can be hundr of page long and the interfac allow open the document to a specif chapter. onc the initi chapter is displayed, i want to load the rest of the book asynchronously. sinc i don't know what direct the reader will scroll, my strategi is to altern load chapter befor and then after the initi chapter:load chapter x -> load chapter x-1 -> load chapter x+1 -> load x-2 -> load x+2 ...i am display the book in a contain div element with each chapter be a div within the container. i'm use jqueri .before() and .after() to insert each chapter as it is fetched. my problem is that the browser automat scroll up when i add chapter earlier in the book. so if i start with chapter 10, the browser scroll up when i add chapter 9 and again with chapter 8 and so forth.on (unsatisfactory) solut to the problem is to make an anchor tag for each chapter and store the id of the first chapter loaded. then after each chapter is fetched, rune the code:keep the initi chapter in the browser viewport. of cours the problem with that is that the reader cannot scroll while the rest of the book is be loaded.ideally, i would like to disabl scrolling, load a chapter and then re-en until the next chapter is fetched. i'm so far unabl to figur out how to do that.
