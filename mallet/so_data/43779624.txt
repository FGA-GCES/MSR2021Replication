in an electron app, i can take a screenshot of my window from the main process use this: fail too. it also too late to perform the screenshot. i get this in the main consol (i.e. it goe to terminal): attempt to call a function in a render window that has been close or released.context: for now i'm explor the limit of what is possibl to do with screen captur (essenti for support purposes), and found that one. not sure yet what i would do with that edg case, i thought about it not just for support, i'm also consid display at startup a blur pic of previous state (some part of my app take 1-2 second to load).ani ideas?
