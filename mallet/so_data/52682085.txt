that titl might be a littl confus but i don't know how to put it otherwise. i have some json encod data in a .json-file:) and creat a page with some predefin head, use the html as content and the json data to creat some button (key=destin &amp; value=name) on there.becaus the project has mani of these page i would love to have onli one file that hold both my html content and the json data so i had all i need for one page would be a singl file access. so the question realli is: how can i store both json and html data in one file so jqueri can access, distinguish and process it?thi is part of an electron applic but i'm not sure if that even matter for that question.
