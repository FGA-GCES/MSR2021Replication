i realis this might be a wide/out-of-scop question - but it appear that none of the exist modul for node are stable/working/useful?adm-zip is the best i'v tri but will sometim fail to read exist zips, seem to have no support for buffer and frequent write zip which are invalid? node-zip (a wrapper for jszip?) fail almost everyth i tri with it - it fail to read most zip and has limit featur for creat zip and again write the odd invalid oneth other librari i found all appear long-dead/unmaintained?thi seem a massiv hole in node capabl - esp given that some tool requir zip-compat archiv support (an exampl would be node webkit which requir a zip (not tar.gz) package)
