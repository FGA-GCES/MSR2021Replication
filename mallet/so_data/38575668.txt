i am tri to get firebas work with electron.it not realli clear if it should be use serviceaccount or not. is electron consid to firebas a server?when run it i get an error call : exception: typeerror: firebase.auth(...).onauthstatechang is not a functionthat becaus i am get https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/firebase.auth and not the web version of auth().i am initi it as i would for the web basically..sinc that seem what would make most sens as you treat electron as a web app essentially. for instanc i dont want to ship a serviceaccount json with my packag electron app.
