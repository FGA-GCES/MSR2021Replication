i haven't had ani success look for this becaus i most find mislead questions, about peopl want to use data from a server insid of their electron app. that not my case.i have a regular app, which use a server on the internet, just like ani other, but we want to make it avail for school without internet (without ani or without reliabl internet), so what i'm tri to do is to creat a version of my server which run from an electron exe and serv file for the student conect to the wifi (but no the internet) to access. after the process is done "offline", i will sync the data from the electron app itself.i tri to run a server from express but i didn't have ani progress so far. what i tri was to put the exact same code from my node server in my main.j file and had no luck.i know that not what electron is suppos to do, if you'r posit sure there is no way to do that, pleas tell me so i can search for anoth alternative.
