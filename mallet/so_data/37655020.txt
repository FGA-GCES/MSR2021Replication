we are work on an applic that will be offer both as a web-bas and as a cross-platform desktop solut by mean of electron.du to custom requirements, the desktop client cannot make use of "the cloud" to store data; all data should be store in the local machin or, even better, the user should have the option to keep the database/data file on an extern hdd so that anoth user on the same local network can use the same data file.we'v been look at nedb, pouchdb, etc, but all these use either web sql or indexeddb on the browser itself to store the data.nedb can theoret use the file system but that seem onli possibl for node webkit apps.anoth option is of cours mongodb, but it requir set up a site on a web server. see as how our user will set that up in on their own machines, that will work for one user onli but would make it veri hard for them to share the data (note: assum user with littl technic know-how).i there a way to forc nedb to persist data in a file instead of the in-brows database?alternatively, doe ani one know of a file-based, compact databas that play well with electron/node?we'd prefer like to use a nosql database, but option of file-bas sql databas will be consid as well.
