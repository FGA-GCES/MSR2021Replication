i'm build an electron app and need to call api where the api provid has not enabl cors. the typic propos solut is to use a revers proxi which is trivial to do when run local by use node and cors-anywher like this:th app can then be configur to proxi all request through the revers proxi on localhost:8080.so, my question are:i it possibl to use node and cors-anywher in an electron app to creat a revers proxy? i don't want to forc the app to make call to a remot server.i there a better or standard way of do this in an electron app? i'm assum i'm not the first to run into cor issues. :)
