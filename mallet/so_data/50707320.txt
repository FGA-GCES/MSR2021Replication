i'm look to see if there a way to view, and more importantly, interact with the electron browser display when run nightmarej autom on aw lambda (or if not on lambda, a web server i set up).i'v success set up multipl nightmar autom job on lambda, and off, and while full autom is definit the ideal, there are time when a real human must interact with a given web page to move past a certain point- i.e. a captcha form that must be complet (anti-autom bot blocker test for a "real human").i have dream up this "semi-automated" approach that would basic "nightmare.wait()" for the user to interact with the browser, then return to full autom afterwards.a high-level exampl would be someth like this:nightmar goto login pagenightmar fill in login form credenti and wait for the real human user to hit the submit button, and then possibl complet a captcha form manually, too.onc complet (login successful), the nightmar autom could determin it past it "wait point" and then the "full automation" (no human interact necessary) would take over from there.i have alreadi implement this local and test it success (set nightmare/electron webprefer config option "show" to true, then interact with the web page shown in the browser window while it "waits" for the next autom step), so i know the semi-automat aspect of it works.however, the part i'm unsur about is how to replic this when the nightmar autom is run on lambda. is there ani way for me to show the electron browser window and interact with it when it on lambda? if not, if i put the nightmar autom on my own web server, would there be a way for me to view and interact with the electron browser window through an ifram in a real web browser (or some other similar way)?i haven't seen a singl example, or even mention, of anyth like this on the web yet, but be abl to achiev this would great enhanc the capabl of web automation. get around "bot blockers" and other anti-autom roadblock would be much more feasibl when it truli think a human is interact with it (which it would be) than straight automation.
