i'm learin electron.j and i want to use aync/await featur in my code but i'm a bit diapoint becaus syntax error are swallow and silent which make my futur project a nightmar for debuging.db module:thi code is tri to connect to mysql and send error if it can't connect, but notic the syntax error "this_should_throw_error" that should halt execut or throw error, but it doesn't and my code has no error at all even if it can't connect to mysql.notic that if i remov syntax error my code work well and catch mysql connect error.i'v read everywher that is normal behavior of javascript async/promis code, but i'd like to know if there is a solut to catch syntax error to make my debug easier. thank you
