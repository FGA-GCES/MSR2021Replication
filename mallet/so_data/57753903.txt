i am develop a softwar that send an audio stream (blob) to a server. i also want that this blob stream can be record at the same time. actual everyth work fine, i can record and export as wav file, but there is no duration, so i can't fast-forward or rewind.th softwar is develop in electron with angular.ther are a few post i found, that this is a chromium bug. is there a way to set the durat manually? i'd like to just grab the date at start and stop and convert it to second and then set it.
