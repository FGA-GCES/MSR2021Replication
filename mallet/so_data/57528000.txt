i have an electron app that will sometim be use behind corpor firewalls.i have ad a login event listen to the app and request usernam and password from the user via a dialog box.it work fine if the user enter their detail correct the first time, but if there is an error with the first attempt and then the user enter the correct detail the second time, the request seem to stall and then timeout. if i activ anoth http request, creat a third auth request, and enter the detail correctly, it works.her is the code from the main process in it current form:if anyon has ani pointer that would be great. at the moment i'm think of just ignor ani second request to get this out quickly.thank
