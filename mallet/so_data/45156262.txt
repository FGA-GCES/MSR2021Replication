we are build a restaur pos system with electron (nodej 7.4.0/electron 1.6.11). for a pos system, speed and reliabl are the 2 most import requirements, and after have spent some time build the app we are no longer certain if electron is the right softwar for us. speed seem to be the main issue. for testing, we'v built an app that onli show 2 "hello world" html page without ani addit javascript or ani other assets. when run on a modern imac, there a short delay when switch between the page and the app flash white between the page loads. on an older pc run window 7, it take up to 1 second to simpli switch between these 2 pages. load time on the mac is 167ms for an empti "hello world" page.now, run these 2 page direct in the chrome browser, the page load instantly, without ani load time and no white flash between page loads. 40ms in the network inspector. the differ in speed is a lot more signific with more complex page load javascript file and imag (even though everyth is load locally)what the reason for the much longer load time in electron vs chrome, what could we be do wrong ?
