my first post here :) i'm work on electron app with vue, and i'm face a problem with display photo on vue front. i have been work with vue for almost a year, but it my first approach to node.j and electron.mi app is remot control by custom cms. i have json file with differ data type inside, some textarea, image, video etc. everi 5 second i'm fetch data from cms to look for chang in structure, if there is a new imag for example, i'm download it from provid link in json file, store local in appdata and then display it at app front. and there start the problem:everytim when i'm upload a new photo, link to local data is transfer to front faster, than it store in files. this result in "broken image" be display in app, whenev i'm refresh app with my help function, imag is display propetly. but i kinda feel it some kind of hack, not expect behaviour. so, i'm fetch the data everi 5 sec by ipcmain like this:whenev i'm do event.reply("get-content", response); it send faster, than file is store in user data. but accord to docs, finish is the last call, so it should fire after store data, am i right? and to be clear, in foreach i have a lot of differ data objects, but i'm store one imag on the time. how to make this call at least "kinda" sych to receiv data from ipcmain after imag is stored? i have tri promise.all, async/await but noth worked.if you need more code or data, fell free to ask, i'll do my best to provid more info.thank in advance!
