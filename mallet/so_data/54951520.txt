not use a pre-exist boilerpl like electron-vue, i'd like to set up a electron app with vue.js. what is the procedur to do so, specif for a beginner?so far,i have instal vue cli global with npm, creat my project with tag to the vue cdn at the top of the index.html works, and caus it to work, but ideal i'd like the electron app to work offline, which i believ was the point of use vue-c as oppos to just import it from the cdn.is there a simpl way to do this? or would i be better off just download vue manually, throw it into a folder in the electron app, and load it with a script tag?
