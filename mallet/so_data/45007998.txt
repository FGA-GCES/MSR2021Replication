in my electron app user interfac (ui), there is a button which when clicked, use child_process.fork() to spin up anoth script. this new child communic status messag use process.send() to updat the ui on the progress. this all work great.in the child process however, there come a point when it time to do some work in parallel (stage6). in stage6 i use the same child_process.fork() method to launch 8 workers. debug messag indic that these 8 worker do inde fork just fine; i keep a refer to them in an array and all seem well.th problem is, that onc these 8 worker are forked, i never hear from them again. their messag sent use process.send() are never receiv by stage6. it like they don't exist.now, here the fun part! outsid of electron i creat a test script (use node on the cli) to launch those 8 worker in exact the same way that stage6 does, and they work just fine and the test script hear their messages. so the issu isn't with the workers, it seem to be how they are launched.in electron, can a process which was itself fork (from a ui in my case) be a "parent" as well and fork children? can we fork insid a fork? or is that just too fork much?
