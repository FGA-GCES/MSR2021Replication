i am tri to follow the instruct on this page: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-distribution#manual-distribut howev it is veri vagu and unclear.i am tri to build an app that is simpli an index.html with some static asset (js, css, images.) there are no call to server-sid api from the client side.th doc say to use this layout:but it not work for me.what is main.js? i assum this is the electron script that should creat the main browser window and set the url to my local index.html, not someth that is run within the webview window.whi doe it say index.html has to be there? i would think the url to index.html is specifi in main.js? (i have all client asset in a "public" folder.)whi doe it need a package.json? i have no script and don't use ani addit npm modules.i have tri a number of layout but all that happen when i double-click electron.ex is that it exit immedi without ani errors. from what i can tell it never execut my main.j script.i can't find ani addit resourc on set up a simpl manual distribution.
