i am build an electron project part of which will programmat set the system network proxi on mac os.it seem there is no built-in system api(neith from nodej nor electron) that can achiev that. as an alternative, i manag to chang the proxi by revok "networksetup" command with child_process module. but each revok will pop up the follow dialogu for the password which is quit annoying.). i am seek for help how to solv this problem after packag (after distribut to users, it is not possibl or user friend to ask user to run the app in termin with root priviledge). my expect is to ask user to grant privilidg onc dure app startup. no grant ani more dure app execution. ani help will be veri appreciated.
