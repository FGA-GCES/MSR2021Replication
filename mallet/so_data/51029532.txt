i'm write an electron app that has to clone and pull repositori everi onc in a while and it work well. however, it fail behind a corpor authent (basic or digest) proxy. as i understand electron can facili the chromium proxi featur but dugite, the git librari i'm using, is run in the main process and tri to connect direct to the git repository.i there some way i can use the proxi for dugite?edit: i did some addit research and figur out that node doesn't handl proxi connect for you. proxi set are onli honour if they are facili insid the render view and onli if they use the browser window method like fetch. therefor i also tri isomorphic-git as a dugit replac in the render process but that - for some unknown reason - didn't work either.accept solut must be code that can be handl insid the electron app.
