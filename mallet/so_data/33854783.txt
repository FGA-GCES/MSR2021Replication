i was given the follow to consider:develop desktop applic use nodeweb kit. also develop web applic use the same code base.appl should look identical.both app must use the same code base. the reason for this is to cut down develop expenses.if it was up to me i would not even consid use node-webkit for desktop. there are far better desktop solut for win platforms. for web applic use node is certan viable.but peopl who plan the project somehow think node is a way to go for both apps.aft lot of thinking, i came to the conclus that do what they want will onli increas dev and mainten costs. i consid use express (mayb even sails.js) for web application. i made some test where i use express on node-webkit and it run just fine.certan nw is powerful platform (popcorn). just in my case i fail to see how can it cut down the dev expenseam i right to be against this solution? is this a plausibl decis and i am not see anoth solution?ani opinion is veri welcom
