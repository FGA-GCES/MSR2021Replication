i made a small app with node webkit. pre-packaging, it work fine. but after i zip it and ad it to contents/resourc in node-webkit.app i get an error when i run the app. it open fine, but the task it doe involv child processes, and i get this error:uncaught node.j errorerror: spawn enoent.i'm guess it might be someth relat to the issu rais in this question: node-webkit child process execbecaus my child process are call pdftk, a separ command line program. ultimately, i'd love to instal pdftk as part of my app - i have not been abl to figur out how to do this. i tri includ it as one of the thing to be zip with the rest of the app, but that caus the app to crash immedi after launch (it would open a window with the correct titl but no contents, which would immedi close).so, main question is, how do i instal pdftk as part of a packag node-webkit app, so that the app can be launch simpli by doubl click the icon rather than use the command line? thank for ani help.
