i have to develop an app with windows, maco and chrome os support – at the veri least. chrome os is an import requir becaus this app is intend to be use in school – where chromebook are a kind of a big deal. as you may know, chrome app are be deprec on windows, maco and linux, so that leav us with two choic for web-bas "native" apps: electron and nw.js.sinc i'm develop this app from the ground up, and not convert ani exist web code, i feel inclin to choos electron for this particular project. however, i can't find ani reliabl / complet / concret answer regard if electron may be use for develop chrome os apps. i found this releas note which states: electron now provid build for linux on armv7. it run on popular platform like chromebook and raspberri pi 2.however, officially, electron onli support windows, maco and linux, which lead me to think that this chromebook support might be somewhat limited, which, in turn, lead me to think that nw.js might be a better choic for this project.mi concret question are: has anybodi success creat a chrome os app with electron? are ani of these app easili instal by regular users? (12 year-old kids) or do they requir some kind of linux-lik hack to get them running?
