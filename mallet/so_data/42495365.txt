i am build an electron app in typescript with webpack, and i am run into the follow vscode debug problem:info: the main process spawn a child process by call fork is need to give one the opportun to regist breakpoint for a node process that is attach to. question: however, what i would like to improv in my debug experi is that a simpl restart of the debugg is not enough to re-regist some new (or old) breakpoints. i have to entir exit my app and start it again, befor the debugg upon restart will again halt at the first line of my build and recogn breakpoint i add at that stage. is there a way anybodi could recommend to improv this debug experience? i don't mind some extra step as compar to a launch debug session, but have to manual quit and start my app just to debug it is a bit cumbersome, and make actual debug in the consol almost more preferable... thank for ani advise!
