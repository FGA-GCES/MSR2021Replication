i'm tri to send a udp packet use the node.j dgram packag from an electron app. the send method call for a buffer, uint8array, or string. i'm get a type error when i tri to use a buffer or uintarray however. the exact error is: typeerror: first argument must be a buffer or a string.i can see in the node.j dgram code that it is check for a buffer use . if i tri use instanceof on the buffer in my code it just return object as the type, while if i tri buffer.isbuffer() it return true. i'v tri all the method that node provid for creat buffer buffer with no results. send doe accept string but then i am run into all sort of issu with encoding, and that feel kinda of hacky.it look like electron is run node 7.4.0.i see my option from here as:edit the node.j codesomehow overrid what instanceof return for my buffer objectfigur out a solut for proper encod the buffer as a string.ani ideas?
