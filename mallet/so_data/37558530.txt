i'd like to start develop an autom test suit against an nwjs app, use the latest version of nwjs (0.15.0), use the javascript bind for selenium/chromedriver.look through the docs, i see that the exampl are primarili written in python. i'm not a nativ python dev, and i'v never use selenium before, and it seem like mani of the tutori out there on the internet were written befor nwjs went through it big 0.13.0 refactoring... so i'm look for some basic clarif on a few core concepts.can anyon provid a basic boilerpl autom script for nwjs, written in javascript, use the post-0.13.0 platform?
