i start mess around with angular 2 and electron, and use this starter package. everyth seem to be go well, i'm even abl to use the node fs packag to read from a directory. the problem i'm have is that i can't seem to be abl to use an absolut path for the readdirsync() method. it onli take a relat path.i did find this in the doc for fs that you can use the url packag to show an absolut path for readdirsync(), like so:both intellisens and runtim both tell me that [ts] argument of type url is not assign to paramet of type string | buffer'. type url is not assign to type buffer'. properti write is miss in type url'. i would have expect the syntax to be the same, but no luck.i have read a lot of post state that they can't run the fs packag in angular 2 + typescript, but it work well for me, as long as i use a relat path. i just need help get the absolut path to work. thank in advance.
