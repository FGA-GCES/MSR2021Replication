i'm tri to access a $scope variabl from the ipcrender implement under an angular control like thisth log result show that the valu of $scope.input is undefined, therefor the valu is not bound in the page.mi initi thought was that sinc we have the $scope avail from the controller(b inject as a parameter), we should be abl to use it to attach valu like $scope.input and then get it bound in the page.howev this doesnt seem to behav as expected.i there anyth that i am miss here or my approach of have ipc insid an angular control is wrong ? pleas suggest ....
