so i'm work on a project with electron, and i need to be abl to display data in tables, and the user would navig through the tabl use arrowkey (for example). in everi tabl there would be some checkbox for the user to make some choices, and then he would go to the next table. eventually, it would be possibl for him to go back to the previous table, where the choic he made would still be saved. the checkbox have some onclick function that i would like to be abl to keep from one tabl to the other.so i came up with this bit of code : (note that i didn't use jqueri here, that part of the code was there befor i tri to use jquery, it will eventu be chang later)th problem is : the html code is save and display perfect when the user goe back, even the check box remain checked, but the onclick function just won't copi ... i'm veri new to jqueri (on this morn tbh, for that specif functionality) so ani bit of help would be great appreci !
