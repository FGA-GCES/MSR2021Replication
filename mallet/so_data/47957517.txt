i see this question has been ask but the context of that question is differ and so there are no answer relav to my use case so i'm ask a new questioni have an electron base web server. it meant for begin web developers, students, and artist that are not use to the command line (ye that a huge debat right there but i was scold by the teacher at the art and design school at ucla for ask their student to use the command line, henc a simpl server with a gui. pleas don't debat this point. it not the point of the question)in ani case, peopl use this web server sometim want to run on port 80. on mac (and linux?) port 80 requir admin right and so i'd like to escal the server permiss to do this.mi understand is the easiest (only?) way to do this is to spawn anoth process. sinc the server part of my web server is effect written in node.j and sinc node.j (or at least the api) is built into electron then it seem like the best solut would be to just re-spawn my electron app to run onli the server portion.in other words, imagin i could run the app likeand maco will ask for admin privileg befor run the server.if i can't run electron with no gui then i could includ a copi of node.j insid the electron packag but it seem like a huge wast of space given the same function is alreadi insid electron. or mayb there is some other solution? (some api call i can make to ask for permiss to use port 80?)
