i have a file upload for user to store images, which i'm save content to a folder within the applic data directori (app.getpath('userdata')). this all work fine.when i attempt to load the imag use a basic imag tag, with the src point to the correct locat within the applic data directory, it fail to render. this onli occur after i'v packag the app use electron-forg (make &amp; package). i'v onli attempt to make for os-x (darwin x-64). i'm guess it has someth to do with asar, but i can't seem to get this working. i'v attempt to use the file protocol for the imag sourc too.ani idea how to correct do this?
