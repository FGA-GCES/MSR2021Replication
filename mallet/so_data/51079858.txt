i'v tri read up on differ explanations, and i can't seem to find out exact what the reason behind this error is.i'm creat an electronj project (in typescript). i have the standard files, main.t as the entry-point and an index.html as the main page. i also ad a renderer.t file, which is suppos to contain code for render-processes, and is includ via -tag in my index.html.main.t but let the function-bodi stay. i don't get the error if i don't use import / requires. i also avoid the error by keep the event handler in the function. whi can't i have the eventhandl outsid the function, in this case?what exact doe import/requir do to the file?it seem to work just fine with main.ts. i hope someon can shed some light on this, especi to further my understand of the inner work of javascript/typescript and also electron.
