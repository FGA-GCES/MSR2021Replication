i have an electron app, i built an addon use napi, and i have a javascript function that updat the ui base on a string input parameter.in the addon, i take the updateui js function and creat a threadsaf function callback for it.then, i start off a long run function (with a lambda) which will eventu callback the threadsaf function to updat the ui. i am abl to success call the function, but i cannot see a way to pass paramet into the call at that time.not go to comment too much on what i'v alreadi tried, but read the document lead me to believ it not possibl (as it doe not mention it). experi with "stuff" in the 4 nullptr in creation and the nullptr in call has not been success either.but i feel like this is a veri simpl featur that should be accomplishable, hope i'm misunderstand or miss someth obvious.in my javascript code, i have a check for null input paramet call for the function, and i can see that in my onclick i am trigger the call with no inputs.i need to make the call with the logtext as input, but i cannot figur out how.ani push to the right direct would be great appreciated. thanks.
