i'v got an electron project in node.j and am current attempt to make distribut easier by collaps the massiv node_modul hierarchi into an asar. this way i can have app.asar and modules.asar, as suggest by various place such as grunt-asar.th problem is that this need me to chang all require() statement to have the asar in the path, like: require('modules.asar/package'). that fine for modul i'm includ from my code but when a modul itself use require('dependency-package') that then fail to resolve. as i understand it, node.j will resolv in the "node_modules" folder for these but there is no "node_modules" directori anymor due to packag modul into an asar.i there anyth i can do to help this?
