i'd like to be abl to open websit like trello, facebook, facebook messenger, asana, whatsapp web, etc as desktop apps. i current use fluid (http://fluidapp.com/), but i'd like to see if electron can be use to do the same thing. assum i have a fresh instal of mac os x 10.10, i think i need to: instal npm (https://www.npmjs.com/).should i instal io.j or node? i have no idea what differ it would make. can npm be instal without either? in ani case, this seem to be quit straightforward: download and instal https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-v4.0.0.pkginstal electron (http://electron.atom.io/). this seem simpl enough (although i'm not quit sure if this is a prerequisit for nativefier):thi is the easiest way i could find. ani other suggestions?alternatively, is there perhap a better but more complic way?to be honest, answer may need to be dumb down quit a bit... i'm not a much of a technic person.
