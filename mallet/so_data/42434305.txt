with my app, when i want to process data there is a threshold that abov it, chrome (electron) cannot cope and crashes. look at ram and cpu it shouldn't happen (cpu and memori below 60%), but the amount of data is high enough (data pars of 500mb files) so that it make sense.but still, is there a way to workaround this? for example, i have tri to chang messag start to get slower and slower befor the crash.so the question is, is there a way that i can workaround this? or these file are just too larg and i'll have to wait for new hardwar iter that can handl them (?)edit:i haven't been abl to solv it by use a worker. while the size were copi quit fast (i'd say in few seconds), the loop crash at the veri beginning.and i have improv a littl bit but still larg not enough by combin the async call to do it not for everi line but for everi 5,000 lines. the loop last a littl bit longer.
