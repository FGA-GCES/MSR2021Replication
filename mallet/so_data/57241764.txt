i creat an electron for a tini compani that connect to a socket.io server. this app obtain the usernam of the log in user and the mac address and send this info to the server for processing. all of this is work fine with regular desktops. now, anoth compani want the same app, but they have a thin client architecture. is there a way to get the app to run in this kind of architecture?i am have a hart time figur it out. i have never dealt with thin clients.1) in the thin client architecture, would i have my socket.io server code and the app in the same server then? if they are in the same server, how could i get the app to connect to the socket.io server? they are in the same machine, so i am confused.2) one problem is the app can't obtain the mac of the thin client becaus onc execut from the thin client it will end up get the mac of the server. is there a way to obtain the mac of the thin client use node.js? is there anoth way of use node to recogn some sort of id for the thin client?i would like the thin client to log in to the server, execut my app automatically, connect to the socket.io server, and send to it the usernam of the log in user and the mac address of the thin client. is this possible? do you have ani suggest on how to accomplish this?
