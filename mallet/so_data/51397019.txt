we are consid develop of a web app use reactj (probably, we will use npm create-react-app feature). also, we are think if it will be possibl in futur to easili transform the web app to a desktop applic use electron. sinc we have no experi with both technologies, we like to ask about this combination, whether it is a good option, and if it is possibl to turn a react web app into a desktop electron-pow app. i was googl ani work tutori how to build an app use both technolog but no one work for me.so, to sum up, is it good choic to start develop a web app with react when we would like to have the opportun to transform it into a desktop applic built with electron? if not, are there ani better technologies?
