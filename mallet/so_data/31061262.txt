i am do some research into build a cross-platform desktop applic use web technologies. both node-webkit and electron/atom would be perfect for the job.however, with it be a multi-window app, my client aren't too keen on the vast number of process which chromium creat (2 per window).i'v look into pass some differ command line switches, api expos method to set the group pid. alas, this is unsupport on window which is my primari target platform.i don't know if you'v ever googl "hide process from task manager", it start to look a bit scari and deep-webish. there must be an easier way.do anyon have some suggest or mayb a differ technology?
