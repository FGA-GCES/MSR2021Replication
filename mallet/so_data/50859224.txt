i was task with chang an electron react app that was written by someon who left the organ i work at. i'v never use electron, just a bit of node.js. basic this app let you creat tabl in a nice gui and then export them as csv file. some tabl entri are hard-coded, and i need to chang one of them. i didn't want to invest time in learn electron from the ground up and just search the app folder for the tabl entri and chang each occur in various file (e.g. main.js, settings.js, bundle.js...) to the new value. this general worked, but one field in the app remain unchanged, and i don't know how to find out where it creat in the code. i tri open the browser develop tools, but press f12 doe nothing. after a quick search i ad this to the main html file:but it doe nothing. also ctrl+shift+i doe nothing. how can i chang this last element? it might be a text field, or an image.. i'v search the app folder for imag file end but noth of interest came up.
