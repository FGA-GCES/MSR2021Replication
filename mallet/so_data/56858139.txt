i'm tri to use electron-webpack to build an electron app with atlaskit. i'v setup the smallest possibl repo to reproduc the issue: fstephany/bug-report-electron-webpack.her my package.json: make me think that someth is miss from the babel transpiling. especi when the releas note of @atlaskit/navigation-next version 5.0.0 explicit mentions: drop es5 from all the flow modul drop cjs support in all @atlaskit packag as a break change, all @atlaskit packag will be drop cjs distribut and will onli distribut esm. this mean all distribut code will be transpiled, but will still contain import and export declarations.ani idea on how to fix this? i'v tri differ babel config but i feel like turn in circle...
