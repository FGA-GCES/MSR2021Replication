i am creat an inventori applic with the backend written in python 3.7. i am use electron to build a gui for it and the node.j modul "python-shell" to be abl to communic with the python code. i would like for all of the code for python-shel to be in a separ javascript file (connector.js). if i run just that file with node from the command line it work perfect fine, but call the function from an html button doesn't work.i know that with one of the last updat to electron nodeintegr by default is false, but i did set that to true. unfortun it still doesn't allow me to communic with the node modul within the electron render process. if i copi the connector.j code into the main.j file use by electron and call it on start of the application, it doe work but call it use an html button also obvious doesn't work.thi is the main.j file for electron with nodeintegr set to true.i am pretti sure that i am just misunderstand the way electron and the main and render process work. unfortun no matter what i look for on the internet i don't seem to be abl to get a solut that actual works.
