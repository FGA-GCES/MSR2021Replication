madden gap in an app i'm develop is there appear to be littl (or no) support for avi in the html5 video implementation. so, i need a workaround that is cross-platform, and package- with my electron app.video are host local i'm not avers to encod on the fli (ffmpeg avi -> mp4 and use html5 natively?) webchimera appear die due to vlc and electron chang (dev can't keep up) (is there anoth npm packag that can do this?) a wrapper that call a nativ vlc instanc might work -- but how do i ensur that vlc is avail on the system with my packaging? should i just spawn a nativ app in a separ window (ie, totem on linux)? (seem clunky)latest videoj-java plugin appar has issu (https://github.com/afterster/videojs-java/issues/2) and ad anoth layer (java) to the electron stack seem somehow unsavory.ffbinari (https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-node) seem promising... but odd ffplay is not avail for linux (though i suspect my linux consum like have a ffmpeg alreadi installed).nb: file are decid avi. i can't chang this.ani hint / pointer great appreciated!updateon my system, use ffmpeg to convert:so i'm lean toward packag ffmpeg with my program and convert befor loading.
