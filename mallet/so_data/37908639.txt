i am fair new to web develop other than basic html5 websit creation, i somehow understand the general structur but i still cannot understand fulli especi electron and nodejs.th other day i was go to creat a webapp, which is similar to wysiwyg text editor but talk in between the browser (html5/js) with the backend (c++ script). what i first tried, was to have a c++ hello world script, which can be execut from the webapp built upon electron. i was abl to run .ex as child_process but i couldn't get to further.now, i took myself a bit deeper research for look into c/c++ addon from nodej but still tri to understand. the basic exampl on the nodej doesn't seem to give me a full understand on how to transfer data.i'm sorri for the long paragraph to describ my status but in short, here are some questions:can anyon give me an idea of how electron/nodej can be use as a browser-backend middl interface?do anyon have a simpl exampl / phedo-cod with a propoer api use to talk in between nodejs-c++backend? is nodej c/c++ addon the onli method ?thank you for reading! and i'll look forward anyon to help me understand.
