my titl probabl doesn't proper captur my question, but i could not find a succinct way to captur the issue.th issu is like this:i have a browserwindow that is trigger by an ipc event. when the broswerwindow opens, it send a messag back to the main process to signal that it has complet loading, and then the main process send it some data with which to perform a specif task. upon complet of the task, the user close the window and execut of a differ process begins.thi all work fine, except that it the applic receiv that event to open the browserwindow again, the event handler that send data to the new window either throw an error indic that it cannot send data to the window becaus the process has been destroy or reopen the window, but with all of the old data from the first time that the window was opened, when what i need is a fresh instanc of the window. i know that i could simpli use javascript to tear down and regener the origin html, but i feel like there must be a better way. here is the code below:main.jsth new window opens, but no data is sent to it.
