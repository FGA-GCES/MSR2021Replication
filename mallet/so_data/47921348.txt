i tri and not resort to stackoverflow too often, but this is drive me nuts. i have a create-react-app which i am tri to wrap into the electron framework. i discov a tutori onlin which basic has you creat everyth from scratch with a barebon webpack config setup, and it works, but onli when start up the webpack dev server first befor start the electron application. this is redund when you want to packag the application, as the package.json start script onli run one command, which is "electron .". so how do i go about includ the static product file of my react app into electron? i have tri it sever time befor without ani success, and the closest i came was point (within the main.j entri file for electron) to my static react index.html file. onli problem was, becaus it was a product build, everyth was minified. for the resourc within this file to load correctly, i had to manual remov all the first "/" from ani src url (you can see how quick that would becom quit cumbersom with larger apps).so i guess my actual question is:how do i "serve" the static file of my react applic so electron load it correctly?(do also take note that i eject the applic in order to make use of css modules)ps: link to the react-electron tutori - https://medium.com/@agro/developing-desktop-applications-with-electron-and-react-40d117d97564
