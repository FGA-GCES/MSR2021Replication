how do i creat a function electron app with multipl instanc of the mainwindow? here a veri simpl app with a mainwindow that just has two buttons. one to creat a new mainwindow instance, and one to close the current window. the abov code will creat multipl todo window and display them on differ tabs. each list titl (todo-1, todo-2, etc) is displayed. the problem is, the last one open is the onli activ one. so if i open three todos, then go to ani one of them and click the close button, onli the third window will close, regardless of which one i was in. then the other two will throw an error if i tri to close them say the object was destroyed. which make sense. so how do i code this so if that whichev instanc tab i am in is the one that i close. and when i close it the next tab i am in becom the valid mainwindow object?
