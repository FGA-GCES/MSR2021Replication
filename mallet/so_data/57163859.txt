i want to creat touch gestures, like in chromium for my electron app. it should just do two simpl things: load the next page, when i swipe left and the previous page, when i swipe right.i found this npm packag https://www.npmjs.com/package/swipe-detect, which seem to be abl to do it. it take a target_domain_node, which i guess is the screen, a callback, which i guess is the function to call on a swipe and the threshold for swipe length.i want to usei guess the format is wrong. alreadi tri to put electron.screen.getprimarydisplay() in {}, but that doesn't chang anything.
