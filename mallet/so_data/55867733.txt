i am have a requir where i will fetch a tabl from db and then show it as a tabular format in the front-end side. the user can edit the data, add a row, or delet a row. after everyth is finish he will click save.now i need to synchron the chang he has made with the tabl in the databas i.e i want the modif he has made to be reflect in the db.-> one thing i can do is truncat the tabl in the databas and do a row by row insert, but this will be a problem caus there is a chanc of data loss.-> i can keep track of all the chang he has made and updat those chang one by one, but this will be veri complex to implement. (at least for me)on more question, for the follow requirement, could you suggest me between use electronj and reactj caus both satisfi my requirement, but i am not at all familiar with electronjs.
