i am work on computer-vis project and tri to find a way how to build a desktop applic with modern ui that will be abl to display live video process by my algorithms. the code that creat video stream and web browser will be on the same machine.i have a nativ c++ code that captur video from ip camera, make some process of captur frame with draw result on them. for exampl - it detect human face and draw bound box on video frames. video process code is quit heavi and can't be translat into javascript.aft that i want to display this frame with box on them in web-bas gui in a desktop applic build with nw.js.the question is how to display process frame with lowest possibl cpu usag overhead?i can compress each frame into jpg(png/bmp...) and send it to tag, but this way will take too much cpu, and this is the worst possibl solution.th perfect solut should be send frame data direct into webgl textur on gpu by nativ code, but i cant find a way how to make it.may be some compromis will be rgb32(24) transfer, but imag stream is quit heavi (about 200 mb per second), this is the stream of one 2mp/25fps ip camera. and in a futur i want to be abl use up to 4 camera on one pc.i have an experi with qt and this task can be solv with qt, but i realli need some html5-base gui with it animations, style and other features.mi target os is windows, but it will be good to have cross-platform solution. and if window is a problem - i can use linux.
