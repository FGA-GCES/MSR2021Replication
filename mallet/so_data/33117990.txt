i have creat a nativ c++ add-on for the winbiocapturesample, i'v test it, and it work when run the nativ code separ in a command window (use node ./test.js). however, when i tri to run it in my electron app, the app blocks. i'v narrow the problem down to the fact that the winbiocapturesampl function requir window focus (if i pass someth else, all work fine). however, it seem that in the electron app, there never is window focus (due to the fact that it is encapsul maybe?). it a long shot, but has anybodi alreadi run into same problem, or someth similar? a possibl solut would be to open a separ command window, but this would be ugli and in case the user close this window, the problem would persist.
