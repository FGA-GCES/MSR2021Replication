i am look to understand a general strategi here. i have hundr of file on my hard drive, with differ file names. in my react / electron applic i would like to use an autosuggest tool, so that the user can type a name and then all the file name that match are be autosuggested.how would i do this most efficiently? would i, in a first step, grab all the file name and store them in some kind of json, link to the actual files, and then hand that json to my autosuggest component? or could i have direct access to the files? what would be the most effici way, general speaking?
