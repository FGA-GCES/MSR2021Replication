i am current work on an electron-app use npm that unzip a file to a select directory. an instal basically. now when i build the applic it still work fine. i simpli start the setup.ex in my win-unpack folder and everyth goe down smoothly. now when i move the win-unpack folder to a differ directori my app run fine but when it start the unzip process it throw the follow error:i have noticed, that the first file-path display (for some reason) doesnt use utf8, but all the other are be display correct (should be an Ã¤). also i have allreadi tri delet the node_modul folder and then run npm i to reinstal them. still have the same issue. the follow is the code that start the unzip process:her i am use the bind modul to requir a .node file which pass a string to my app. and this seem to be the modul that caus the error.i have been tri to resolv this for hour now, but noth i'v found onlin works. also i couldn't find anyon who had the same error that i have. ani suggest on how to fix this would be appreciated.greetingsmatt.sedit:i might have just figur out the main problem. the bind modul contain a function that look for the modul root. this path is display in the first line of the error. howev sinc this app has allreadi been built, all the sourc code is insid of an app.asar file. bind can't seem to distinguish between the .asar file and an ordinari folder. so even tho the path is correct, it doesn't work. the reason whi it work in the origin win-unpack is becaus bind (if it cant find the module-root) move up througth the directori until it find the root. and sinc the origin win-unpack folder is insid my project directori bind use the un-built module-root.
