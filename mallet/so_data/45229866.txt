i'm program a small electron program, that (currently) is abl to download multipl big file from googl drive. some file are too big to be scan so it trick the server into believ the "download anyway" button was clicked.th problem is, that after 3, 7 or 12 files, the chrome dev tool window show "render process gone".3 files:- download unblock turn on while tri to download the same block file 3 time in a row. the 4th file crashes.7 files:- mixtur of 5 non-block file and 2 block one with download unblock turn on. the 8th file (non-blocked) request crashes12 files:- download 9 non-block file and 3 block one while download unblock turn offtherefore, i came to conclude, that "unblocking" a file take up 3 of the 12 possibl "slots". then, everyth (or at least the numbers) would make sense.unblock work by send anoth request with the same cooki char and a ?confirm=xxxx at the same url.not that the whole thing doesn't crash after 12 file if i use anoth file provid with 100mb test files.it would be extrem help if you could point me in the right direction.her a realli simplifi version of the code that used. note that a lot of variabl declar and other stuff is missing, but these part seem to be the problemat ones:&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;&#xd;
