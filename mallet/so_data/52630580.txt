good afternoon.i was wonder whether it is possibl to add a config.json file to a vue cli 3 project that can be read at runtime, both dure develop and production.th config.json file will contain some string the app can use to chang content dynamically, such as the video file that are display to a user and the ip address of a printer.unfortunately, the data is onli read at build time and compil into minifi javascript. this mean the app is not updat even if the user updat the variabl in config.json after the app is built. i need to be abl to access config.json in the build files, updat a valu and then have the app read the new valu at runtim without the need to build the project again. i was wonder if it is possibl to do this.ani help you can provid will be great appreciated.
