i am use the sqlite3 modul for node.j with the electron module. i am new to javascript and am struggl with callback and asynchron code.mi intent is for the gettabl function to run, build the tabl array and pass that array through to the callback function which is the uset function.so this function should build and pass the tabl array:when i run this, the consol show no errors. it seem the the uset function run befor the tabl array is complet in the gettabl function which i thought was one of the main purpos of a callback, to wait for asynchron code to run (in this case build an array) befor take that array and pass it through to anoth function.how do i make sure that the tabl array in the gettabl function is complet generat befor pass it through and run the uset function?
