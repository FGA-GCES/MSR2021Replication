i am tri to repurpos an old .ex i made use tidesdk a coupl year ago. i have replac the relev tidesdk code with node-webkit code, and everyth seem to be work as expected. with one exception, the origin (tidesdk .exe) use multipl html page with simpl anchor tag to chang the view. when i use this method with node-webkit the screen flicker between view (it display whatev program are run in the background for mayb ~200ms - 300ms). doe anybodi know a solut to fix this? i could re-build as a singl page app use angularj - but would prefer if i could keep the structur i have as time is an issue.i would realli appreci an input on this.edit:her is a link the the .nw file, if you put this in you you node webkit folder and run it you can see the issue: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9h53kyyidi4qslr/test.nw?dl=0 i didn't want to packag it as an exe so you can see what is happening.
