well, i am current work on a desktop app use electonjs. i have a built electron exe file that receiv a url to show from the command line. so let say:th second instanc of my app will be veri slow.i'v done my research and found that the onli thingbecom slow is the startup. i'v check it by open the devtool right after the window is created, and it took more than5 second (slow af).ok it turn out that if i run one window with light websit like http://info.cern.ch/and more heavi websit like stack overflow, the startup is not so slow.i am so confused.
