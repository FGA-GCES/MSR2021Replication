i'm look for lead on how to captur web page metadata from the current browser page. i want to creat a featur in my applic that will allow the user to press a hot key and record meta data from the web page current open in the user browser. my applic will be run minimized, this featur is to be activ by a global hot key.i'm use nw.js (former node-webkit) to creat this application, so ideally, the solut would be javascript run in a desktop instal of node.js. if this is not practical, i understand that i can call platform specif code from nw.js, so solut develop in ani desktop os languag would be of interest.mi applic target os x and windows.i'm hope to captur metadata from all major modern browser (chrome, firefox, safari and ie 10+).at a minimum i need to captur the page url, but i also want to captur keywords, descript and highlight text for the sourc web page.i need to implement this function without modifi the sourc webpag in ani way, and i prefer to avoid the need for browser extensions, bookmarklet or plugins. if a solut exist use a remot control browser extens (no user interaction) that would be of interest, but ideal i want to avoid requir the end user to instal or interact with anyth but my application.mi search to date has locat no inform on read web page inform from applic outsid the browser.ani thought or lead are much appreciated.
