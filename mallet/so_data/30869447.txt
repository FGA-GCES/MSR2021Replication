i have a veri particular case and i don't know if this is possibl to be done.i'm use nwjs to run a web app as a desktop app. i need to zip/packag the sourc file becaus my code should not be avail to eavesdroppers. this packag will be deliv on a flash drive. and this is were my troubl begins. there are a lot of .pdf file that must be ship togeth with the package. the user can brows which pdf he want to open, and when he click it, the pdf is "downloaded" to his pc. the content of the pdf is not avail on the application. i have a list with the name of each pdf file.if i zip/packag the .pdf togeth with the sourc file it becom a huge .nw file and it take forev for my applic to load. i need to mantain the pdf on a separ folder and they need to be access through the sourc code. this is easi if i run the applic direct without packag it, as nw use the relat url to it root, but when i do packag nw use a temp folder for the sourc file and i can't use relat url to access the pdf folder.th onli approach i can think of is to write a js script to identifi where the flash drive was mount but i don't know if this is possible.i have to support window and mac for this case.
