i am use electron-build and i want to distribut a new version of my app to a subset of users. i found out that this is possibl use stage rollout but the document about the function and the way that it work is not so detailed.let say that i have my latest stabl releas at version 1.0.0. i want to releas a new version (1.0.1) to a percentag of the user (10%) and then if it has bug or it broken, i want to be abl to updat onli the broken version to 1.0.2 and distribut it to the same 10% users. is such a thing possible?on possibl but "dirty" solut would be to updat the broken version (1.0.1) for all user with the previous latest stabl version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.2) and then releas again the improv version (1.0.3) to the 10% of users.
