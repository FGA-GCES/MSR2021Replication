## New contributor guide

We categorize our issues avaluating two metrics:
- Skill level

See at [labels tab](https://github.com/FGA-GCES/MSR2021Replication/labels). 


## Getting started

To understand project's file structure take a look at [Getting Started](./getting_started.md). For more information on how to create documentation for this project see the [how to contribute to our documentation](./how_to_docs.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you identify a problem with the docs or code, check to see if a problem already exists. 

If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue, as a rule two types of [issue form]() are used.

they are:
- Bug report and the Standard

#### Solve a problem

Please review our [existing issues](https://github.com/FGA-GCES/MSR2021Replication/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow your search using `tags` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/FGA-GCES/MSR2021Replication/labels) for more information. As a general rule, we do not attribute problems to anyone. If you find an issue to resolve, you can open a PR with a fix.

### make branches

The original repository must be forked. As a rule, creations of branches in the original fork will not be accepted.

### Commit your update

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
