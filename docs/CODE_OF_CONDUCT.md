# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

with the objective of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project 
and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity 
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

# Our Standards

### **Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:**

↳ Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

↳ Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

↳ Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

↳ Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

↳ Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

### **Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**

↳ The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

↳ Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

↳ Public or private harassment

↳ Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

# Execution Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and 
fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, codes, wiki edits, issues and
other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when 
appropriate.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also applies when an individual officially represents the community in 
public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address and linking to the project 
repository.
