### App architecture

Questions in this topic discuss the fundamental logical structure of the desktop application in terms of, e.g., routes, views, and components. An example of this kind of questions is *AngularJS $routerProvider not working properly in node-webkit*, in which one developer asks for help in configuring the AngularJS router included in his application. Noticeably, the names of several JavaScript frameworks appear among the top words of this topic. Indeed, during JavaScript application development, it is common practice to adopt such frameworks to properly structure the application architecture when the logic becomes more extensive and difficult to maintain.

**Considerations:**
  * Desktop web application development requires the usage of abstractions and frameworks to properly manage the application's logical structure when dealing with growing application complexity.
