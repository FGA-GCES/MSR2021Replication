# commit politics

Changes must be made following a pattern, indicating the issue resolved and the functionality (or fix) added.

**âž” Use tags to define the purpose of the commit:**

`ADD` : when to add a new feature
    
`DEL` : If it is a commit related to removing something
    
`UPDATE` : when to update some functionality
    
`FIX` : for referencing fixes

`DOC` : to indicate documentation
    
`REFACT` : indicates code refactoring

`DOC` : indicates relationship with documentation

## Example commit structure:

    git commit -m "[tag] (Issue #x) : descriptive message"
